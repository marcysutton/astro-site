        About Marcy Sutton Todd
      </RouteTargetHeading>

      <p><em>(See <a href="#bio-short-version">bonus short version, below</a>)</em></p>

      <p>In October 2024, I joined the nonprofit <a href="https://khanacademy.com">Khan Academy</a> as a Senior Engineer on the Frontend Infrastructure team. I'm thrilled to be working on React design systems and accessibility for a platform with such a big impact!</p>

      <p>Previously, I was a senior front-end developer at <a href="https://principlestudios.com">Principle Studios</a>, a remote digital agency with a strong engineering team and a fantastic culture. I was overjoyed to build websites again, growing the engineering skills and career I want to have. Principle was acquired in March 2024 by Shift Paradigm, a marketing tech firm. I led the front end on an Adobe Experience Manager project before leaving the company for my new role.</p>

      <p>In 2022, I launched an online workshop series <a href='https://testingaccessibility.com'>testingaccessibility.com</a> with the folks over at <a href="https://egghead.io">Egghead.io</a>. I spent a great few years as an independent accessibility engineering consultant and trainer, working with tech organizations such as Spotify, Microsoft, Google, Pinterest, T-Mobile, Change.org, Evinced, and more.</p>

      <p>In the past, I led the docs team as Head of Learning at <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Gatsby</a> before deciding I prefer to stay as an individual contributor developer. I also worked as a Developer Advocate and Senior Frontend Engineer on the <a href="https://www.deque.com/products/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">axe-core</a> team developing web accessibility testing tools. Before that, I worked as an accessibility engineer at <a href="https://adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Adobe</a>, and as a web developer at <a href="https://substantial.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Substantial</a>, <a href="https://wearepop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">POP</a> and <a href="https://deicreative.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">DEI Creative</a>.</p>

      <p>I'm passionate about improving the web for people with disabilities and I've done a lot of teaching and speaking about it. My blog, <a href="http://a11ywins.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Accessibility Wins</a>, highlighted accessible user interfaces and tools. In 2016, O'Reilly presented me with a Web Platform Award for my work in accessibility. I'm a former leader of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/a11ysea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Accessibility Seattle Meetup</a> and I founded a social coding group for women in called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NW-Tech-Women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">NW Tech Women</a>.</p>

      <p>My education includes a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Journalism from Brooks Institute of Photography and an Associate of Applied Arts in Web Design & Multimedia from the Art Institute of Seattle. I became very interested in web development during college, creating HTML websites for photo documentary classes and later, <a href="https://marcy.codes/v2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">interactive Flash websites</a>. I naturally went back to HTML & CSS, with ECMAScript experience that helped me fall in love with JavaScript. When I learned about Web Accessibility, I liked that it reflected my values and added meaning to my work. I love solving problems with design and code when they have potential to help as many people as possible.</p>

      <p>I'm inspired by nature, street art, typography, and music, and I try to appreciate life's ups and downs. I like cooking and baking pies, and doing night photography. I'm also pretty hooked on <a href="https://instagram.com/marcysutton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="My Instagram - Link opens in a new window">riding bikes and playing outside</a>.</p>
