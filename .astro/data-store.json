I created a series of learning resources about web accessibility to increase adoption and make our digital world more inclusive.\n\nWith Testing Accessibility, I'll provide you with workshops, articles, and more to improve your technical _and_ people skills around accessibility. I've put 13+ years of experience as a web developer and educator into this project, including the few years at the beginning when I didn't know _anything_ about accessibility. We all have to start somewhere!\n\nThis project was partly inspired by Kent C. Dodds' [testingjavascript.com](https://testingjavascript.com), which included an interview with me from a few years ago. I also recorded an [accessibility course](https://egghead.io/courses/start-building-accessible-web-applications-today) for [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io), my Testing Accessibility project partners, and I've wanted to do more ever since.\n\nBut most importantly, I see a continual need for technical, yet human education about accessibility. Industry giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Pinterest have sought out my training for accessibility, as they needed help just like everyone else.\n\nMy goal is to teach you how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for good. You’ll make the digital world a better place, particularly for people with disabilities who might not be able to use your sites and apps otherwise.\n\nSubscribe for email updates from this site's homepage or on the Testing Accessibility landing page to be notified when things drop: [https://testingaccessibility.com/](https://testingaccessibility.com/)\n\n\u003Cem>For questions or support related to Testing Accessibility, contact the team at \u003Ca href=\"mailto:team@testingaccessibility.com\">team@testingaccessibility.com\u003C/a>.\u003C/em>\n\nPrevious feature: [Frontend Masters Workshop: Accessibility in JavaScript Web Applications](/frontend-masters-javascript-accessibility)","src/content/features/testing-accessibility/index.mdx",[22],"/src/site-images/testing-accessibility-banner-3@2x.png","953db11bb4fc6e3f",true,"smashing-book-6",{"id":25,"data":27,"body":32,"filePath":33,"assetImports":34,"digest":36,"deferredRender":24},{"title":28,"description":29,"path":30,"coverImage":31},"Smashing Book 6: New Frontiers in Web Design","I wrote a chapter in the latest Smashing Book on Accessibility in Single-Page Applications","/smashing-book-6","__ASTRO_IMAGE_/src/site-images/smashing-book-6.jpg","\u003Cdiv class=\"floating-image\">\n    \n    ![Gorgeous embossed hardcover of Smashing Book 6 on top of an illustrated map](./smashing-cover.jpg)\n    \n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"floating-image\">\n    \n    ![My book chapter on Accessibility in the Time of Single Page Apps](./smashing-chapter-start.jpg)\n    \n\u003C/div>\n\nI wrote a book chapter on Accessibility in JavaScript Apps in the latest hardcover book from Smashing Magazine, \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/09/smashing-book-6-release/\">New Frontiers in Web Design\u003C/a>. I'm thrilled to have been included as an author in this beautiful hardcover book! My chapter sits amongst others on modern web development topics, such as using CSS Grid, Service Workers and Progressive Web Apps, Asset Loading, Conversational UIs, and more.\n\nIn my chapter, I wrote about the specific aspects of accessibility to consider when developing a predominantly \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/client-rendered-accessibility/\">client-rendered\u003C/a> website or application. I covered things like focus management, HTML semantics, announcements, and testing. There are a few different code examples in the chapter written in React.js, Vue, jQuery, vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. But this topic is bigger than any one framework or library, so I intentionally focused on the user impact when the DOM is rendered and manipulated dynamically with JavaScript. It's worth remembering that users don't typically notice or care how a website was built; they only care if they can use it.\n            \nThese are subjects I'm very passionate about, as accessible web applications are often critically lacking accessibility to a point where they cannot be used by people with disabilities. We can do so much better. I sincerely believe that with more information, developers can make a huge impact in our users' lives.\n\nTo read some of my tips \"in a nutshell\" for JavaScript app accessibility included in the chapter–plus a few more that I wish I'd published–check out my blog post on Deque.com: \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.deque.com/blog/accessibility-tips-in-single-page-applications/\">https://www.deque.com/blog/accessibility-tips-in-single-page-applications/\u003C/a>\n            \nI also wrote about this subject for Smashing Magazine a few years back, when I was working on the Angular team. The framework code might be a little dated, but the concepts still apply: \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/client-rendered-accessibility/\">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/client-rendered-accessibility/\u003C/a>\n\nAccessibility is an evergreen topic that persists regardless of the JavaScript framework flavor or feature of the month. Accessibility basics matter, as do inclusive JavaScript development skills; we can serve more users by incorporating accessibility into every application and website we put out into the world, and I'm delighted to show you how.\n\nYou can purchase a hardcover copy from Smashing for $39 US, or $19 US for a digital copy.

I wanted to show web developers how to work accessibility into modern JavaScript apps since they commonly have accessibility issues that present barriers to people with disabilities. It is also my opinion that JavaScript isn't going anywhere, so we might as well talk about how to make digital experiences built with it more accessible.\n\nMy slides are available on GitHub, along with a demo application with examples and a homepage full of resources:\n\n- Slides: https://marcysutton.github.io/js-a11y-workshop/slides\n- Demo app: https://marcysutton.github.io/js-a11y-workshop\n- Repo: https://github.com/marcysutton/js-a11y-workshop\n\n## Accessibility debugging\n\nIn the workshop, we started off with some accessibility debugging techniques including keyboard testing, color contrast debugging, using accessibility browser extensions like axe and Accessibility Insights, zoom and magnification, and screen reader testing. This part went by fast, and it felt like it could have been a whole day workshop by itself!\n\nAccessibility debugging skills are useful no matter what kind of website or web application you're working on, so it was (hopefully) a useful introduction regardless of each student's JavaScript app experience. This section also set up the rest of the workshop material by providing techniques to test code along the way and prevent some of the technical debt typically committed when accessibility is continually deprioritized. \n\n> When developers take charge of basic accessibility testing in each commit or pull request, they often ship less technical debt and free up time for specialists to evaluate more complex and nuanced accessibility issues.\n\n## Intro to accessibility in JavaScript applications\n\nAfter debugging, the course went on to cover the unique parts of accessibility in modern web-apps built with JavaScript. I focused mostly on accessibility in React.js and Gatsby but I also worked very hard to include vanilla JavaScript examples for every section (quite ambitious, now that I look back on it).\n\nIn this section, we covered:\n\n- Focus management requirements and patterns\n- Announcements using ARIA Live Regions\n- Semantic HTML\n- Unobtrusive animation with `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- Progressive Enhancement\n\n## Automated accessibility testing\n\nTo wrap up the day, we went on a foray into automated testing of pages and units using Cypress, Jest, and Testing Library. I've taught on this subject for a few years and it's been really cool to see the tools evolve–no more struggling with test frameworks to test for accessible events! I couldn't believe how smoothly this went, it made me fall in love with automated accessibility testing even more.\n\nAny time you're building accessibility into a web application, ensuring test coverage for custom functionality can provide a contract with your fellow developers (and even your future self) so if a code update breaks accessibility, you'll know about it. Tests asserting keyboard focus management and UI mechanics are so powerful! And with tools for various parts of the testing lifecycle, you can build in accessibility coverage for both the nitty-gritty details (unit testing) and the bigger picture (integration or end-to-end tests). \n\nAdding an accessibility test API like `cypress-axe` on top of your custom tests can add another layer of test coverage without a huge investment, as writing your own color contrast rules is a very steep learning curve, as I learned from experience working on the axe-core team.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that automated testing can only go so far, however; you still need to test sites manually for accessibility to ensure you're not unknowingly shipping barriers for people with disabilities. I also recommended working with organizations that specialize in accessibility user testing, such as Fable Tech Labs or Knowbility's Access Works. Someone in the room in Minneapolis mentioned a similar group in their city, which was a good reminder to check your local area for accessibility test specialists with disabilities. It's very much worth the investment and effort to make accessibility testing part of your regular process!\n\n## A gift to the future\n\nWriting a workshop for Frontend Masters was as big of an undertaking as I thought it would be–perhaps even more–but I'm so glad I did it based on the comments from viewers around the world. I'm a bit of a perfectionist so I coded and tested and worked late into the night on material for months to be ready for the live workshop streamed and recorded for learners across the world. I may have given up most of my summer to get this workshop off the ground but now you can all watch it and hopefully embed accessibility into your development workflow.\n\nSince publishing this course, I've also been notified that any accessibility workshop or talk of mine qualifies for Continuing Education Credits for the IAAP accessibility certification, and this course is part of that! If my materials helped you in some way, I'd love to hear about it [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/marcysutton.com). What accessibility wins have you been able to achieve?\n\n---\n\nPrevious feature: [Smashing Book 6, New Frontiers in Web Design](/smashing-book-6)","src/content/features/frontend-masters-javascript-accessibility.mdx",[47],"/src/site-images/frontend-masters-feature.jpg","377961876c7e3a82","talks",["Map",51,52,74,75,97,98,120,121,143,144,166,167,189,190,212,213,235,236,258,259,281,282,304,305,327,328,350,351,373,374,396,397,419,420,442,443,465,466,488,489,511,512,534,535,557,558,578,579,601,602,623,624],"a-web-for-everybody-smashing-conf-whistler",{"id":51,"data":53,"body":60,"filePath":61,"assetImports":62,"digest":64,"rendered":65},{"title":54,"date":55,"path":56,"videoSrcURL":57,"videoTitle":58,"posterImg":59},"A Web for Everybody: Smashing Conf Whistler",["Date","2015-02-22T00:00:00.000Z"],"/talk/a-web-for-everybody-smashing-conf-whistler","//player.vimeo.com/video/118697675?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0","Vimeo - A Web for Everybody, Smashing Conf Whistler","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./images/a-web-for-everybody-smashingconf.jpg","In December 2014, I got to travel up to Whistler, Canada to speak at the first Smashing Conf Canada.

Read on for more details. The lessons still stand: test in assistive technologies, report bugs to browser and AT makers. Makes the world a better place.\n\nWhile working with the team at [DEV](https://dev.to) this past quarter on their open source community platform, [Forem](https://www.forem.com/), they requested I review a Pull Request for accessibility on GitHub that introduced a new Chrome-only CSS feature: `content-visibility`. I'd missed the announcement of this feature months earlier by Chrome advocates, so my first step was to read up on it to understand the potential accessibility impact.\n\n## What is `content-visibility`?\n\nAccording to a post on [Web.dev](https://web.dev/content-visibility/):\n\n> `content-visibility` enables the user agent to skip an element's rendering work, including layout and painting, until it is needed. Because rendering is skipped, if a large portion of your content is off-screen, leveraging the content-visibility property makes the initial user load much faster. It also allows for faster interactions with the on-screen content.\n\nThis feature is meant to improve page load performance by skipping over content detected as being \"off-screen\", or outside of the viewport. There are two possible values for `content-visibility`: `auto` and `hidden`.\n\nThe [Forem PR](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/11560) from Ben Halpern included `content-visiblity: auto`, which marks content as off-screen that will become visible in the viewport through scrolling, telling the browser to skip it in the initial rendering phase. The `hidden` value tells the browser to skip content that shouldn't ever automatically render on-screen through scrolling, more akin to CSS `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` but with extra performance benefits. Potential use cases cited are advanced virtual scrollers and measuring layout.\n\nNeat. But my spidey accessibility senses went off as soon as I read those words: **off-screen** and **rendering**. We use off-screen content in the accessibility world to render content for the purpose of exposing to screen readers, such as visually-hidden headings or `\u003Cspan>` elements inside buttons. Screen readers typically utilize the [Accessibility Tree](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/), a parallel structure to the DOM that contains only what is rendered on screen and is affected by things like CSS `display: none` and `aria-hidden: true`.\n\nMy initial thought was that `content-visibility: auto` could pose an access problem on initial load by suppressing part of the page outline from screen readers, so I set out to test it.\n\nThe Web.dev team included a [nice demo on Codepen](https://codepen.io/vmpstr/pen/xxZoyMb) that I used right away, since a local Forem instance requires a more involved setup to mimic the live [Dev.to](https://dev.to) site. I noticed the Codepen authors had marked up `.story` DIV elements with CSS `content-visibility: auto` applied, with headings preceding those DIVs (so therefore outside). They'd possibly anticipated an accessibility issue, but didn't originally write about it* in the post.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \n    ![HTML snippet with an h2 preceding a DIV with the .story class](h2-snacks-story.png)\n    \n\u003C/figure>\n\nA Google search turned up two posts from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/more-on-content-visibility/) and [Steve Faulkner](https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2020/08/25/short-note-on-content-visibility-hidden/), but neither touched on the impacts of `content-visibility: auto` on semantic structure. So here I go, writing about it!\n\n> ***Update, March 12, 2021:** Google has updated how `content-visiblity` works in Chrome 90 (see below). Una Kravets also notified me she updated the page on [Web.dev](https://web.dev/content-visibility/#a-note-on-accessibility) to include a note about accessibility.\n\n## Accessibility impact on semantic structure\n\nIn earlier versions of `content-visibility` (Chrome 85-89), headings and other content were suppressed by `content-visibility` if considered off-screen. That meant content would be hidden on load from the Elements List in NVDA and rotor in Voiceover, impacting the overall page outline and summary read aloud.\n\nTo test this, I moved an h2 in and out of a DIV with `content-visibility: auto` applied. When the heading was outside of the DIV like they set it up in the demo, it was rendered. Here's a screenshot of the Elements List in NVDA:\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"border\">\n    \u003Cimg src=\"./nvda-elements-list-before.png\" alt=\"\" />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>\n    NVDA Elements List showing all headings, including being \"stocked up on snacks\"\n    \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nWhen moved inside of the `.story` DIV with `content-visibility: auto`, the heading was suppressed by screen readers including NVDA (as expected):\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"border\">\n    \u003Cimg src=\"./nvda-elements-list-after.png\" alt=\"\" />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>\n    NVDA Elements List missing a heading\n    \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nThis meant that if you were trying out `content-visibility` on sections of content including headings and semantic structure in Chrome 85-89, screen reader users would't be able to benefit from that structure on load. This unfortunately degraded accessibility in favor of loading performance until it was fixed, [partially due to this post](https://twitter.com/sundress/status/1346685692974284800).\n\n**Based on my testing, I initially recommended keeping headings and landmark elements outside of regions styled with `content-visibility: auto`.**\n\nWithout this approach of crafting semantic markup for rendering on load, `content-visibility` as initially implemented would have negated the purpose of including semantic structure to begin with. It would have required scrolling the page for a complete and accurate outline read aloud; likely not what developers would intend by using it! Fortunately this behavior was marked as a bug and fixed.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, the Chrome team had some discussions along the way about accessibility in `content-visibility` but the production implementation had some issues. I'm glad to see they've fixed it and are [improving their QA process according to Alice Boxhall](https://twitter.com/sundress/status/1368757783210827784). It makes me feel for accessibility folks, though. If you don't watch features like a hawk for accessibility, the ball is very often dropped.\n\n--- \n\nNote: the PR from Forem ended up marking only the footer content with `content-visibility: auto` since it's at the bottom of the page and would theoretically benefit from deferred rendering. But one caveat to the Forem usage was the site's infinite scrolling, where users couldn't reach the footer anyway...so whether that content would be accessible on page load in assistive technology was moot. See the [PR](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/11560#issuecomment-733223791) for more discussion if you're curious!","src/content/posts/content-visibility-accessible-semantics/index.mdx","e26cdcc9604c83e4","2009-12-02-why-outlook-2010-sucks",{"id":657,"data":659,"body":663,"filePath":664,"digest":665,"deferredRender":24},{"title":660,"date":661,"path":662},"Why Outlook Sucks",["Date","2009-12-02T00:00:00.000Z"],"/why-outlook-2010-sucks","[Fix Outlook 2010!](http://fixoutlook.org \"Fix Outlook!\")\n\nI work endlessly to make my web-pages and HTML emails work across platforms, browsers, and email clients. I have learned about the quirks of each publishing outlet and try to anticipate inconsistencies when laying out a specific design. However, I am reminded daily of why I dislike Microsoft — Outlook 2007 (and now Outlook 2010) cannot render even the most basic HTML in an email, when the same email looks great nearly everywhere else.\n\nFor example, on a recent HTML email campaign, I had my HTML perfect in what I thought were all major email clients. I tested in Outlook 2003, Outlook Express, Mac Mail, Gmail, GoDaddy webmail, Yahoo and more. I should have already known this, but a “problem child” emerged, forever an infinite thorn in my side: Outlook 2007. It cannot render the simplest of CSS attributes (like width + height), and completely ignores many others; background colors drop out, margins are meaningless, and a lot of CSS does not actually cascade. Even Outlook 2003 can get it right, since it uses the Internet Explorer engine (IE being desirable – imagine that!). However, Outlook 2007 and 2010 both use the Word engine. That’s right, Microsoft is using WORD to render HTML, and they are continuing the practice with the newest release of Outlook. It makes my blood boil just thinking about all the redundant HTML/CSS hand-holding required to make Outlook play ball.\n\nThe current state of CSS in HTML emails on the Campaign Monitor website says it all. Have a look at the Outlook 07/10 column, particularly the sections on the Box Model and Positioning & Display:\n\n**[Guide to CSS support in email clients](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/)**\n\nThe article below from Email on Acid discusses this issue, and the future of Outlook is just as infuriating:\n\n**[Microsoft Not Playing Nice with Office 2010](http://www.emailonacid.com/blog/details/C13/12)**\n\n“It doesn’t appear that Microsoft is going to play nice with HTML rendering in Office 2010. They are continuing down the ‘07 path by using Word to render HTML. Are you surprised? Honestly, we aren’t. We have recently received a beta version of Outlook 2010 and through our tests we have noted the same rendering problems from Outlook 07.\n\n“Why are they so stubborn? Microsoft’s reasoning behind using Word to render HTML is that emails composed in Outlook 07+ will look consistent when viewed by other Outlook 07+ recipients. They also claim that using the Word engine allows users to easily cut and paste from Microsoft office products directly into their email. To review a complete online explanation from Microsoft [click here](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HA102109301033.aspx).\n\n“The problem is that not everyone uses Outlook and to assume that recipients will see an email the way that it is composed in Outlook 07+ is a common mistake. In actuality, Outlook has a very small market share in the ever-expanding world of email clients. To assume that they are the only provider is par for the course for Microsoft, therefore it is not a big surprise that they are headed in the same direction for Outlook 2010.”\n\n—\n\nDoes anyone else have an Outlook horror (or success) story?

I initially tried using the [BulkLoader Class](http://code.google.com/p/bulk-loader/), since filesize wasn't much of an issue, but I ran into trouble when I needed to add things to the queue after loading began.\n\nI was trying to load multiple external assets at once (1 swf, 1 css file, multiple images), but couldn't quite figure out how to order the sequence because of the dependency on a loaded XML file. I posed this question:\n\n> **What are the best practices for program initialization and chain loading of assets in AS3, particularly when the site structure is created from an XML file?**\n\nFirst and foremost, I was loading a single SWF and an XML file containing the _navigation / page structure_, _page id's_, _page content_, and _slideshow image filenames_. I tried using the Bulk-Loader class to load the XML and a CSS file up front, and then loaded all images while populating the site. It was a multi-part process: download xml, assign page instances, load images and text formatted via CSS, and show page 0. I wondered: was there a way to somehow use a single preloader for all of this bulk-loading?\n\nA few notes about my initialization process: there was 1 frame in the timeline, and only the preloader existed on the stage. The contents of the website (navigation, pages, subpages, background images, slideshows, etc.) were all initialized as new objects based on the loaded XML, next removing the preloader clip and starting the movie. I was also implementing SWFAddress, so the preloading sequence was critical to master.\n\nI luckily discovered [AS3 QueueLoader](http://code.google.com/p/queueloader-as3/) -- it enabled me to add assets to the queue on the fly after the XML was loaded, and still kept my preloading as one process. Sweet!\n\nI hope this helps somebody. Let me know if you have any questions about it!\n\nHere is some code that adds images to the queue after the XML has loaded (a lot of details omitted):\n\n```\n \nprivate function init():void {\n    _oLoader = new QueueLoader();\n    _oLoader.addItem(PATH+cssURL, css, {title:'cssContent'});\n    _oLoader.addItem(PATH+\"xml/copy.xml\", pageXML, {title:'pageXML'});\n    _oLoader.addEventListener(QueueLoaderEvent.ITEM_PROGRESS, onItemProgress, false, 0, true);\n    _oLoader.addEventListener(QueueLoaderEvent.ITEM_COMPLETE, onItemComplete, false, 0, true);\n    _oLoader.addEventListener(QueueLoaderEvent.QUEUE_PROGRESS, onQueueProgress, false, 0, true);\n    _oLoader.addEventListener(QueueLoaderEvent.QUEUE_COMPLETE, onQueueComplete, false, 0, true);\n    _oLoader.execute();\n}\n \nprivate function onItemComplete(evt:QueueLoaderEvent):void {\n    if (evt.title == 'cssContent') {\n        css = StyleSheet(evt.content);\n    }\n \n    if(evt.title == 'pageXML'){\n        pageXML = XML(evt.content);\n        processXML(); // creates page objects based on XML\n \n        for(var i:int=0; i\u003CpageXML.PARENT.length(); i++) {\n           //loops through XML for background images and adds them to various\n           //sprite layers for simple turning on and off\n \n          numSubPages = pageXML.PARENT[i].PAGE.length();\n          var pageImgHolder = new Sprite();\n          pageImgHolder.name = 'page'+i;\n          pageImgHolder.x = 0; pageImgHolder.y = 0;\n          bgImgHolder_mc.addChild(pageImgHolder);\n \n          for(var j:int=0; j\u003CnumSubPages; j++) {\n              if(String(pageXML.PARENT[i].PAGE[j].@IMAGE) !== '') {\n                  bgImg = new Sprite();\n                  bgImg.name = 'page'+i+'img'+j;\n                  bgImg.alpha = 0;\n \n                  pageImgHolder.addChild(bgImg);\n                 _oLoader.addItem(PATH+'images/'+pageXML.PARENT[i].PAGE[j].@IMAGE, bgImg, {title:'page'+i+'img'+j})\n \n                  trace(pageImgHolder.parent.name+'/'+bgImg.parent.name+'/'+bgImg.name+' = '+pageXML.PARENT[i].PAGE[j].@IMAGE);\n                 }\n             }\n          }\n      xmlLoaded = true;\n    } \n}\nprivate function onQueueComplete(evt:QueueLoaderEvent):void {\n    trace(\"** \"+evt.type);\n    imgHolderLoaded = true;\n \n    Preloader.instance.spinnerDone();\n    startMovie();\n \n    bgImgHolder_mc.turnOnImg(0, 0);\n    //turns on image for page 0, subpage 0 (i have a very complicated architecture)\n}\n\n```","src/content/posts/2010-02-17-as3-loading-workflow-xml-first-then-multiple-assets.mdx","fad1a846d8ec2aa5","2010-04-25-simple-xml-in-php",{"id":693,"data":695,"body":699,"filePath":700,"digest":701,"deferredRender":24},{"title":696,"date":697,"path":698},"Simplexml in php 5",["Date","2010-04-25T00:00:00.000Z"],"/simple-xml-in-php","I found a new love in PHP — SimpleXML. I recently discovered I can traverse an XML tree just like I do in Actionscript, right in the middle of an HTML page. This makes it easy to create a website with all content in an XML document, a technique I like to use on projects that do not have the budget for a CMS. XML is useful for organizing site navigation and image/copy content in a central place, thus making it a breeze to update. You can then use `SimpleXML` to inject content into an HTML page with just a few lines of code.\n\nAccording to the [W3Schools:](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_simplexml.asp)  \n_“The SimpleXML function lets you convert XML to an object… This object can be processed, like any other object, with normal property selectors and array iterators.”_\n\nUsing SimpleXML is as easy as loading the XML file and adding it to a SimpleXML object (this requires PHP 5):\n\n```\n\u003C?php\n$file = file_get_contents('navigation.xml');\n$xml = new SimpleXMLElement($file);\n?>\n```\n\nSay you have your navigation organized in a basic XML file. It can be as simple or complex as you like; that’s the beauty of XML. My example below has attributes for page titles and URLs, which could easily be combined into one attribute and transformed accordingly with a PHP loop — for this example I kept them separate. Query strings are totally optional — it just depends on how you want to generate your subpage URLs (using $\\_GET or separate physical pages?).\n\n```\n// navigation.xml\n\u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> \n\u003Cnavigation>\n\t\u003Cpage title=\"Home\" url=\"index.php\" />\n\t\u003Cpage title=\"Projects\" url=\"projects.php\">\n\t\t\u003Csubpage title=\"Personal\" query=\"personal\" />\n\t\t\u003Csubpage title=\"Technical + Geeky\" query=\"technical\" />\n\t\t\u003Csubpage title=\"Creative\" query=\"creative\" />\n\t\u003C/page>\n\t\u003Cpage title=\"About Me\" url=\"about.php\" />\n\t\u003Cpage title=\"Contact\" url=\"contact.php\" />\n\u003C/navigation>\n```\n\nYou can structure your XML file however you like by adding/removing child nodes and attributes to fit your website’s particular requirements. To generate HTML output from the XML file above, I like to use a `foreach` loop:\n\n```\n \n\u003Cdiv id=\"nav\">\n \n\u003C?php\n$file = file_get_contents('navigation.xml');\n$xml = new SimpleXMLElement($file);\n \n$checkit = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'];\n// for checking the current page \n$path = 'http://.'$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'/';\n// useful for generating full subpage URLs and preserving the domain in links \n \n$counter = 0;\n \necho \"\u003Cul>\\n\";\nforeach($xml->children() as $page) {\n   $numSubChildren = count($page->children());\n    \u003Cli\";\n   if($numSubChildren > 0) {  // add a class to \u003Cli>s with children \n   echo\" class='hasChild'\";\n   }\n// form href from path and url attribute \n echo\">\u003Ca href='\". $path . $page->attributes()->url. \"' class='navLink\";\n \n// replace pesky ampersands in attributes \n$pageTitle = str_replace(' & ', ' &amp; ', $page->attributes()->title); \n \n// add class to current link \n if(strstr($checkit, $page->getName()))  {\n\techo \" current'>\".$pageTitle;\n}\n else {\n\techo \"'>\".$pageTitle;\n}\necho \"\u003C/a>\\n\";\n \nif($numSubChildren > 0) {\necho \" \u003Cli id='sub\".$counter.\">\n           \u003Cul>\";\n \n   foreach($page->children() as $subpage) {\n// loop through subpages \n$subtitle = str_replace('&','&amp;',$subpage->attributes()->title);\n \necho \" \u003Cli class=\\\"subLi\\\">\u003Ca href='\".$path.$page->attributes()->url.\"/\".$subpage->attributes()->query;\n \n// this method uses URL rewriting, but can also be used with plain query strings\n// ?subpage=$subpage->attributes()->query; \n \necho \"' class='navLink'>\".$subtitle.\"\u003C/a>\u003Cli>\\n\";\n\t\t}\necho \"\t\u003C/ul>\\n\";\n$counter++;\n\t}\necho \" \t\u003Cli>\\n\";\necho \" \u003C/ul>\\n\";\n?>\n\u003C/div>\n\n```\n\nI love this method because it is so simple to use — but it has potential to grow into complex code, as you can see.

Before a month or two ago, I couldn't have told you how to really hide text from screen readers (and I received conflicting reports on how to do it). Through the process of code, review and repeat, I nailed down some of the basics of CSS and Javascript for improved accessibility.\n\nOne of the keys to improving screen reader user experience: users shouldn't be forced to listen to ALL of the content on the page when it is being hidden from sighted users (think Javascript accordion). Here's how to really hide content from screen readers:\n\n```\n\u003Cstyle type=\"text/css\">\n.reallyHidden {\n      display:none;\n      visibility:hidden;\n}\n\u003C/style>\n```\n\nNot to be confused with offscreen positioning, which is still read aloud to screen readers. This method is used to provide context for background images (like graphic headlines and logos) and to hide access menus from sighted users:\n\n```\n\u003Cstyle type=\"text/css\">\n.offscreen {\n      position:absolute;\n      left:-50000px;\n}\n\u003C/style>\n```\n\nThe other thing I've spent a lot of time on is making custom JavaScript widgets keyboard & screen reader accessible (tab switchers, accordions, etc.). Because these widgets present new content on interaction, we have to alert screen reader users to that new content and make it clear what's going on.\n\nThere are three parts to this accessibility requirement:\n\n1. Updating links after triggering action to indicate what they will do: Expand vs. Minimize\n2. If links are kept short for visual reasons (i.e. `Expand >`), add offscreen text to provide context:\n    \n    ```\n    \u003Ca href=\"#\" id=\"trigger\">\n          \u003Cspan class='tip'>Expand\u003C/span> \n          \u003Cspan class=\"offscreen\">content section\u003C/span>\n    \u003C/a>\n    ```\n    \n3. If new content appears on screen, send focus there dynamically so screen reader users know it has been added. Be aware this takes focus away from the link, but this only really affects keyboard users.  \n    \n    ```\n    \n    $('a#trigger').click(function(e){\n         // span.tip needs logic for toggle, this only goes one way\n         $(this).find('span.tip').text('Minimize');  \n         $('#newContent').focus();\n    });\n    ```","src/content/posts/2010-12-29-css-and-accessibility.mdx","576e8985695b200b","2010-12-29-xmas-js1k",{"id":738,"data":740,"body":744,"filePath":745,"digest":746,"deferredRender":24},{"title":741,"date":742,"path":743},"Christmas JS1k",["Date","2010-12-29T00:00:00.000Z"],"/xmas-js1k","Gifted the benefit of R&D time at work, at the end of 2010 I submitted an entry to the [Christmas JS1k contest](http://js1k.com) along with my fellow POPsters.

There were two nights where I picked less than stellar showcases but the other three I chose were beyond expectations. Not having a pass this year, I put a lot more effort into researching the artists before settling on events. It was a daunting task at first since I had heard of barely anyone on the extensive bill, however, with the Internet's help I discovered some amazing new artists and favorite new mixes by scouring Spotify, Soundcloud, XLR8R and Youtube ([peep my pre-festival mix](https://open.spotify.com/user/marcysutton/playlist/1CzuiVwa8DY4xxHWB1dCBQ \"Link opens in a new window\") on Spotify). I got out on the dancefloor, absorbed a sh\\*t-ton of bass (with earplugs of course), and made musical memories to last a lifetime. Or at least until next year! Long live Decibel Festival!\n\nHere are my favorite mixes and finds by artists of Decibel Festival 2012:\n\n## [MiMOSA - Future Trill Mix](https://soundcloud.com/tigranmimosa/mimosas-future-trill-mix \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nMimosa rocked Showbox at the Market for the Bass Cadets showcase. \"I'm just a 24-year-old kid living a dream\", he said. Boy, did he get a giant room of people moving. A little bit dirty hip hop, a little bit dubstep...this guy rocked my socks off. Best show of Decibel Festival I experienced, hands-down.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F42724021&amp;show_artwork=true\">\u003C/iframe>\n\n## [Sepalcure - XLR8R Mix](https://www.xlr8r.com/podcast/2010/09/sepalcure \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nMachinedrum & Braille make up the electronic duo Sepalcure. Their set at the Baltic Room for the Hotflush Showcase was forward-thinking and very danceable. Their sound is bouncy, bass-heavy and an interesting blend of influences: dubstep, twostep, African rhythms and house. Braille's solo set earlier in the night was fantastic as well—these are some of my favorite artists for sure.\n\n## [George Fitzgerald - XLR8R Mix](https://www.xlr8r.com/podcast/2012/06/george-fitzgerald \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nGeorge Fitzgerald came on after Braille and changed up the musical style a bit from future-thinking tribal/electro/two-step beats into more nostalgic house music—a gutsy move when people are grooving so hard and anticipating Sepalcure's set later— but he seriously rocked it. The crowd danced harder than ever, hands to the sky and good vibes all over the place. An abundance of pulsing bass and funky Daft Punk-esque electro sounds made this a memorable set. Looking forward to hearing more from this guy.\n\n## [Nosaj Thing - Mary Anne Hobbs Mix](https://soundcloud.com/nosajthing/nosaj-thing-mary-anne-hobbs \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nBecause I had a bike race earlier on Saturday I couldn't make it for all of the Do Over, a free outdoor show at the Broadway Performance Hall, and I am still bummed about it. I showed up late and immediately fell in love; sun, beats and great people watching. LA beatmaker Nosaj Thing played a really good set that I was sorry ended so soon. I can only imagine how great Dam Funk, jRocc and the other Do-Over guest artists were!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F41875676&amp;show_artwork=true\">\u003C/iframe>\n\n## Do-Over Bonus:  \n[Best of Quantic Mix by JRocc](https://soundcloud.com/tru-thoughts/best-of-quantic-mix-by-j-rocc \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F24737387&amp;show_artwork=true\">\u003C/iframe>\n\n## [Max Cooper's XLR8R Mix](https://www.xlr8r.com/podcast/2012/09/max-coopers-decibel-mix \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nI didn't see Max Cooper play since he was on at the same time as Sepalcure but I loved this mix found on Twitter the day before the Festival started. \"Over the course of an hour, Cooper frequently lays down a steady beat, but isn't afraid to move away from pounding rhythms to indulge in a melodic detour or a pop-minded impulse. Favoring sounds that are clean, even pristine, there's occasionally a sort of delicate feel to the proceedings, a sensation that's only strengthened by the producer's precise mixing.\" _\\-XLR8R_\n\n## [Jerome LOL - 45 min Boiler Room Los Angeles DJ Set](https://soundcloud.com/platform/lol-boys-45-min-boiler-room \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nJerome LOL played great tunes to a sun-soaked late afternoon crowd at the Do Over. So I was excited to see him play again at the Friends of Friends Showcase alongside Groundislava, Salva and Shlohmo on Sunday night. He played great tunes for a while but seemed on the edge of something—possibly exploding—just before taking his set off a cliff. Pretty sure he got kicked out of the club for being too drunk immediately after an awkward finish to his set. Groundislava followed with some interesting song selections and better DJ'ing but he had a serious case of musical A.D.D. that made him hard to follow on the dancefloor. I didn't have the energy to stick around for the main acts. Not the best night at Decibel but I am still happy to have heard these guys.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F58812077&amp;show_artwork=true\">\u003C/iframe>\n\nAlso, a LOL Boys mix I found & loved, with the exception of the Call Me Maybe remix. ;)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F53932282&amp;show_artwork=true\">\u003C/iframe>\n\n## Favorite tune of the festival:  \n[Bobby Womack - Love Is Gonna Lift You Up (Julio Bashmore Remix)](https://soundcloud.com/juliobashmoremusic/bobby-womack-love-is-gonna \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nFriends of Friends label bossman Lazy Brow dropped this tune right before handing things off to Jerome LOL at the Baltic Room.

(That seems so obvious when I ask it out loud.) The answer is, YES!\n\nWith smartphone and tablet usage growing dramatically for users of all kinds, it recently occurred to me that we should apply the same principles to mobile web that we do for desktop. At POP, we haven't been required to test webpages with mobile screen readers...yet. But I know people who use their devices this way, so I wanted to learn more. Many people in the blind community use iPhone with VoiceOver enabled since it has the \"best accessibility in the mobile space\" (quote from [Steve Sawczyn](https://twitter.com/steveofmaine/status/325081431900581888 \"Link opens in a new window\"), my colleague over at Target). That means, it's easy to test if you have an iPhone–just turn on VoiceOver from your General settings menu (easiest is to enable triple-click of the Home button) and start listening.\n\nHere are some of the things I've found after developing & testing specifically for mobile web with VoiceOver (Note: I plan to test other devices as well, this is just the beginning):\n\n## The Double-Tap\n\nVoiceOver users interact with a page by selecting an element via single-tap and then double-tapping to click. A custom toggle widget such as an accordion or interactive tile bound with only a 'click' event can be unusable because 'double-tap' is essentially two clicks. My accordion widget was opening and closing on each double-tap, making it very frustrating to use with VoiceOver. To get around this on a recent mobile site, we included a touch-specific event library to bind the 'tap' event instead of a 'click'. The events 'dblclick' (included in regular jQuery) and 'double-tap' (custom event) don't fire in Voiceover, but 'tap' does work, as I found in my initial testing on both iPhone and Android devices. The 'tap' event made my accordion behave the way it was supposed to. There is also a difference in mobile Safari with and without VoiceOver enabled, so be sure to test both.\n\n### What is the 'tap' event?\n\nHow is 'tap' different than 'click' and 'touchstart/touchend'? Touch events occur sooner than clicks because they skip the delay added to make sure a user is really clicking (read some great info from the [jqTouch blog](http://blog.jqtjs.com/post/205113875/milliseconds-responsiveness-and-the-fast-tap \"Link opens in a new window\")). We wanted to specifically rule out someone swiping down the page when coding the interaction for an accordion panel, so we needed more than just 'touchend'. Because this isn't officially in our QA or development budget yet, we implemented the existing [jquery.finger](https://github.com/ngryman/jquery.finger \"Link opens in a new window\") plugin to bind the 'tap' event. If you are coding something for desktop and/or older mobile devices, you may need to bind clicks as well. Be sure to test with all of your target devices–screen readers included. More info on taps vs. clicks here: [Tap vs. Click: Death by Ignorance](https://coderwall.com/p/bdxjzg \"Link opens in a new window\") by John Bender\n\nDeveloping for VoiceOver may require you to disable user scaling with the meta viewport tag: after all, the double-tap is usually used to zoom in to something. If you are going down this route, be sure to consider whether this is something you can and _should_ disable–it really depends if your content is readable at a small screen size. In our case, the site was designed & coded specifically for tablets and smartphones so it was an acceptable user experience.\n\n## The same HTML, CSS and JS rules apply (mostly)\n\nYour HTML needs relevant text that tells users what is on the page even when they can't see it. Images need alt text, headings must be used and Javascript widgets need labels that update when you interact with them.\n\nJust because you're developing for mobile web doesn't mean you can ditch the regular accessibility standards. ([See my other post](/css-and-accessibility/ \"CSS + JS + Accessibility\") with tips for basic front-end accessibility). I have, however found that there are a few bugs–or should I say quirks–that make developing for VoiceOver a unique, sometimes frustrating experience. For example, VoiceOver will stop reading text when it encounters a child element placed offscreen. See this code:\n\n```\n\u003Cp>\u003Cspan class=\"offscreen\">Brand Name \u003C/span> introduced 2012\u003C/p>\n```\n\nVoiceOver reads \"Brand Name\", the only portion that is offscreen, and leaves off the rest of it (the same is true of \u003Cstrong />, \u003Cem />, or any other inline tag). Combining on- and off-screen text together to be read by JAWS like we normally do for desktop doesn't work in this case. You have to put the entire sentence onscreen or offscreen for VoiceOver to read the whole thing. The example code below does get read as a sentence (\"Brand Name Expand Panel 1 of 12 In-page Link\"):\n\n```\n\n\u003Ca href=\"#in-page-link\" class=\"accordion-trigger\">\n    \u003Cimg alt=\"\" src=\"../_ui/img/_mobile/logo-sprite.png\" class=\"sprite\">\n    \u003Cspan class=\"offscreen\">Brand Name \u003Cspan>expand\u003C/span> panel 1 of 12\u003C/span>\n    \u003Cspan class=\"icon-in-pseudo-element\">\u003C/span>\n\u003C/a>\n```\n\nThis is stuff I discovered with mostly trial and error. Because every design and dev experience will be different, my best advice is to enable VoiceOver and listen for yourself!\n\n### DOM tricks at a Glance\n\n- HTML5's new heading algorithm is fine for VoiceOver, unlike old versions of JAWS.\n- Offscreen text methods sometimes hide content from VoiceOver. Experiment with offscreen classes, negative text-indent and color:transparent or position:absolute to remove it from display but still be read aloud.\n- Provide users information offscreen about widgets as they update, for example: \"Unique Content Title Expand 1 of 12\" (default state) & \"Unique Content Title Collapse 1 of 12\" (active state)\n- Use CSS pseudo-elements or background-images for display icons and flourishes that make no sense when read aloud (such as + and - for an accordion panel)\n- Alt attributes in images are sometimes the only thing read aloud in a group of child elements. Consider using an empty alt attribute and putting a whole sentence offscreen so it makes sense when read.\n\n## Mobile Web Accessibility Resources\n\n- [Are Mobile Applications Required to be Accessible?](https://www.ssbbartgroup.com/blog/2013/01/11/are-mobile-applications-required-to-be-accessible/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- [Voiceover 2 – a WebDev’s guide](http://alastairc.ac/2007/12/voiceover-2-a-webdevs-guide/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- [iPhone accessibility with VoiceOver](http://blind.wikia.com/wiki/IPhone \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- [Mobile Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/ \"Link opens in a new window\")","src/content/posts/2013-04-22-mobile-web-accessibility-with-voiceover.mdx","7978f243e9ed0cac","2013-11-18-girl-develop-it-web-accessibility",{"id":792,"data":794,"body":798,"filePath":799,"digest":800,"deferredRender":24},{"title":795,"date":796,"path":797},"Girl Develop It Web Accessibility",["Date","2013-11-18T00:00:00.000Z"],"/girl-develop-it-web-accessibility","In 2013, I became a member of an amazing community: [Girl Develop It Seattle (opens in a new window)](http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/seattle \"Link opens in a new window\")! I first got involved with the group on [Meetup.com (opens in a new window)](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Seattle/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and joined Intro to Javascript as a Teaching Assistant to see what it was all about.\n\nI met some fantastic people and got really energized about making a small difference in my community. Upon talking to our local organizer, Heather Wade, I found out that GDI just so happened to have a Web Accessibility curriculum that was a perfect fit for me to pick up. I expanded it from one two-hour class to two and added some hands-on code exercises. Now that both classes are over, I can say that my inaugural teaching gig was one of the best experiences of my life. We had great conversations and I think everyone got a lot out of it. I know I did!\n\n> Class last night was just so good... Really, I felt like I should have paid to be there. I know the class didn't fill up, but it is a niche topic. In this case, I felt the smaller group size worked out really well. You are so awesome!\n\n_Thanks to Heather Wade, my awesome GDI Seattle co-chair._\n\n## Topics that Connected\n\n### Offscreen Content\n\nTo new developers, learning that you can put content offscreen is a pretty handy tool for accessibility. CSS allows you to add content to your pages that screen readers will read aloud without having to jam everything into an image alt attribute (it's also helpful for SEO). For example, what if you're building an interactive annual report with a bunch of highly-designed tabular data? One solution is to embed an image for a table and put the live data offscreen. Pretty freaking cool.\n\n- The presence of inaccessible Flash content\n- CAPTCHA - images presenting text used to verify that you are a human user\n- Links or buttons that do not make sense\n- Images with missing or improper descriptions (alt text)\n- Screens or parts of screens that change unexpectedly\n- Complex or difficult forms\n- Lack of keyboard accessibility\n- Missing or improper headings\n- Too many links or navigation items\n- Complex data tables\n- Inaccessible or missing search functionality\n- Lack of \"skip to main content\" or \"skip navigation\" links\n\n_Pictured: Problematic Items from the [WebAIM Screen Reader Survey (opens in a new window)](http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/ \"Link opens in a new window\") with data offscreen and topics we discussed highlighted in secondary color_\n\n### Tab Index\n\nDo you ever set tab index in your HTML? I'm actually very curious if anyone has a reason to use tab index values other than 0 or -1. In my experience, numbers higher than zero only cause problems since they create a new tab order. As a User, I'll tab once or twice in a document and all of a sudden I'm in the footer. Managing tab index numbers for large documents is hard to do. I had my students play with tab index on native (anchors, form inputs, etc.) and non-native elements (div, h1, etc.) and I think they were quite surprised! To keep the class at a basic level, I did have to skip Javascript, but experiencing a new tab order seemed to have an impact on my students' budding development skills. Success!\n\n## What I'm Thinking About Now\n\n### Localization\n\nI'm a big advocate for offscreen text, especially for links that open in new windows. A valid question was brought up in class: how would you manage all of your accessibility content when localizing a site? Hopefully you could use templating and content files (like JSON) to let the computer do the heavy lifting for you. Without \"seeing\" all the content you're putting into your pages, however, it might cause mistakes–especially for a development team new to the process of building accessible websites. Definitely something to think about.\n\n### Headings & HTML5\n\nHow do you explain the importance of headings & screen readers to new developers, and then turn around and explain how different/weird they can be in HTML5? It's a difficult topic. At their most basic level, headings add a semantic outline to your documents. Screen readers also use them to navigate, so they're an important accessibility tool. But if you've ever had to support old versions of JAWS while pushing ahead with new technology, you might be aware of the [bugs (opens in a new window)](http://accessibleculture.org/articles/2011/10/jaws-ie-and-headings-in-html5/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and lack of support of not only the new heading algorithm, but also [basic HTML5 tag support (opens in a new window)](http://tink.co.uk/2013/02/screen-reader-support-for-html5-sections/ \"Link opens in a new window\"). I'll continue to refine my explanation of this topic since it's so important!\n\n### Web Components\n\nAfter speaking at SeattleJS and attending CascadiaJS I've started to think more about what my future conference proposals will entail. Ever since Angelina Fabbro's talk on the ShadowDom at the first CascadiaJS, I had questions about the ShadowDom & accessibility. This time around, Soledad Penades' talk about Web Components and Audio got me thinking again about accessibility. For example: how does this new technology work with a keyboard? I've heard there is [ARIA support (opens in a new window)](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2012/07/notes-on-web-components-aria/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), but I'm also thinking it's the perfect time to do some research (and maybe even make some impact on a new standard!).

So I’m a leader at my job now. I don’t manage people, but I’m the head of the learning experience and documentation of the Gatsby website and app framework, which the founders and investors both consider core to their product mission.\n\nI joined the Gatsby.js team because it was an amazing opportunity to make an impact, and honestly I was ready for a change. I’ve loved migrating my WordPress website to Gatsby using new technologies like React.js, GraphQL and Cypress. Even in its earliest raw state, I felt it was my best and most fulfilling work in years. To be able to contribute my skills and make a difference with accessibility in the website-building platform I chose made me seriously consider leaving Deque, even though I wasn’t actively looking to leave. In this moment I feel as if I’ve finally paid my dues, moving through a few roles that were good and necessary for me to get here, but ultimately not the best fit for me.\n\nIt feels wonderful knowing that my experience and perspective is a total asset to Gatsby.js, and it’s why they hired me to be their Head of Learning. They needed someone very technical with web technologies \u003Cem>and\u003C/em> capable of making their already-great learning experience the best it can be. I’m just getting started, though, and it’s definitely a team effort!\n\nI’ve been a leader once or twice before, including when I co-led the Seattle chapter of Girl Develop It and the one-off Girl Develop It Bellingham coding club. Over the course of my career as a web developer and teacher I’ve seen a lot of poor leadership from managers and executive directors, and I’ve learned from those experiences that I want to be the most effective and caring leader I can.\n\nBecause that’s the thing: we don’t work or volunteer in a vacuum. Not listening to others and thinking you know best doesn’t equate to successful teams, and it certainly doesn’t work for anyone in a leadership position. Trust and good communication are key qualities that I value as a leader, team member and human being.\n\n## Turning a disappointing outcome into better opportunities\n\nIn the past few months we’ve seen (in my opinion) a disappointing leadership implosion at Girl Develop It, a national nonprofit that I was involved with for 5 years. You can read about led us to this point in the \u003Ca href=\"http://an-open-letter-to-gdi-board.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">open letter to the GDI Board\u003C/a> signed by over 200 chapter leaders, instructors and volunteers, plus a timeline of events. It has been a perfect storm of incidents of \u003Ca href=\"https://hashtagcauseascene.com/blog/2018/12/05/shanise-barona/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">poor treatment of women of color\u003C/a> at chapters and GDI HQ, extremely inadequate communication, lack of trust, and an army of under-appreciated volunteers who know that it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nIn December 2018, I closed the 2-year-old GDI Bellingham coding club because my values no longer aligned with the Girl Develop It organization and the way they handled pretty much everything. The leaders of GDI Seattle and many other chapters have gone on hiatus and resigned, as well. New initiatives have sprung up in various cities as many of us still want to give back to our communities. I started a new group in Bellingham called \u003Ca href=\"https://www.meetup.com/NW-Tech-Women/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NW Tech Women\u003C/a>, a social and casual volunteering group focused on encouraging women in tech \u003Cem>and\u003C/em> making them feel safe and empowered. We don’t shy away from talking about issues of race and white supremacy; in fact, facing our complicity in an effort to do better is a cornerstone of the group. It is only by having difficult conversations and admitting our privilege (or lack thereof) that we can truly serve our communities and build their trust.\n\nSo that brings me back to what I feel are the necessary values and actions of a successful leader:\n\n\u003Cul>\n    \u003Cli>Listening.\u003C/li>\n    \u003Cli>Being available.\u003C/li>\n    \u003Cli>Making sure people feel seen and heard.\u003C/li>\n    \u003Cli>Learning and growing from your mistakes.\u003C/li>\n    \u003Cli>Fostering a culture where members feel empowered and trusted.\u003C/li>\n    \u003Cli>Doing all you can to make people feel safe.\u003C/li>\n    \u003Cli>Backing up your words with actions in a timely and meaningful manner.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\nEven though it’s okay to disagree with people sometimes (we’re human), we still have to be empathetic to the good faith experiences of those around us. Because a lot of it is about power; some people hold theirs over others while simultaneously denying its existence. I’ve seen leaders point blame at anyone and everyone but themselves even when they’re the core of the problem; it makes for the least satisfying game of BINGO ever (“it’s the website’s fault!” “We'll fix it with Salesforce!” “It’s the chapter leaders' fault for complaining!”). An inability to recognize others’ pain and the harm you’ve caused to them is gaslighting, and let me tell you that Girl Develop It is the last organization where I expected to see that.\n\n## The power we wield\nThis reminds me of the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?ei=Q_RVXOGFEtOM0PEPjsq9qAI&amp;q=js-js-js+debate&amp;oq=js-js-js+debate&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...9501.10107..10275...0.0..0.78.458.7......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i8i30j33i22i29i30j33i160.PE8BtGIzlz4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">debate over JS-JS-JS\u003C/a> vs. the traditional web architecture of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which in my opinion is really difficult to solve. The web is more capable and complex than it used to be, and there are bajillions of ways to create web experiences–including (and often excluding) accessible ones. \n\nModern web development tools have allowed us to create some powerful applications in a language that I personally enjoy a lot more than some of the older server-side alternatives. But it’s also been more difficult for “non-hardcore devs” to contribute to frontend projects when everything is built with JavaScript. I’ve been called “not a hardcore developer” to my face in front of a client before, so I know how harmful these gatekeeping sentiments can be to one’s confidence and career.\n\nSome of it is about choice–if you don’t want a blog assembled with JavaScript and CSS-in-JS, use other tools–but it’s also about power. The people making decisions about tech stacks have it. Hiring managers who insist on a specific shape of organization have it. Whose talent are they leaving out by not fitting neatly into that division of labor? Are there ways to solve the same tech problems with more a culture of inclusion, where a wider range of people can do their best work and produce a good result together? I don’t think there’s an easy solution, and that’s why I say this is difficult. But one thing I have learned is the importance of being open to hearing other people’s experiences, rather than plugging your ears and going “la la la” and hoping problems will go away.\n\nHere’s why I care: listening to other perspectives as a leader means you might ask different questions in key scenarios (like product planning) and solve things in a way that includes more people. It allows you to truly adhere to a product or organization mission and serve its members and audience most effectively. Without listening, you might wield power for your own benefit alone and not realize who you’ve harmed or left out along the way.\n\n## Onward and upward\n\nI’m thrilled to make an impact with Gatsby.js and NW Tech Women, taking all of these experiences forward with me in an effort to do good. I’m grateful for the privilege to learn from my mistakes. And I hope I can serve those around me with the same level of empathy and care that I’ve come to expect from others.","src/content/posts/2019-02-03-great-leadership-gatsby-girl-develop-it.mdx","27220702fae78e94","2015-04-25-button-focus-hell",{"id":828,"data":830,"body":834,"filePath":835,"digest":836,"deferredRender":24},{"title":831,"date":832,"path":833},"Button Focus Hell",["Date","2015-04-25T00:00:00.000Z"],"/button-focus-hell","> Note: This post (in part) led to a web standards proposal by Brian Kardell and Alice Boxhall called [CSS Input Modality](https://github.com/alice/modality/blob/master/docs/modality-mq.md) and later, the proposed CSS pseudo class \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible\">:focus-visible\u003C/a>. The problem described below can be addressed with the :focus-visible polyfill, or alternatively, the [What Input](https://github.com/ten1seven/what-input) library by Jeremy Fields. They are really helpful tools!\n\nWhen I started working on [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), there was a lot of low-hanging fruit with regards to things I could fix for accessibility. One of my [first Github issues](https://github.com/angular/material/issues/197 \"Material buttons should be accessible, opens in a new window\") captured the state of `mdButton`, a fancy [Material Design button](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html \"opens in a new window\") component using `\u003Ccanvas>` to create an interactive [touch ripple](http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/responsive-interaction.html#responsive-interaction-user-input \"Material Design specification, opens in a new window\"):\n\n```\n\u003Cmaterial-button class=\"material-button-raised\">\n  \u003Ccanvas class=\"material-ink-ripple\" style=\"top:0px; left:0px\">\u003C/canvas>\n  \u003Cbutton class=\"material-button-inner\">\u003C/button>\n  \u003Cspan class=\"ng-scope\">Button\u003C/span>\n\u003C/material-button>\n```\n\nAngular Material Button, August 2014\n\nA few things have changed with this UI component since then, including the tag name, now `md-button` for brevity; CSS class prefixes; and, the ripple approach, which instead of `canvas` nests a child `div` with CSS animations. My first accessibility pass put the text content into the native child button. Buttons provide native semantics and are focusable by default, so text content can be read aloud in a screen reader. (This exercise showed me that UI framework developers really need accessibility skills.)\n\nAngular Material has come a long way since then. We’ve added a bunch of features and closed 1500+ Github issues! These days, you can instantiate `mdButton` by including the custom element in a [project with the required dependencies](https://github.com/angular/material/#installing \"Github Read-me opens in a new window\").\n\n```\n\u003Cmd-button>Button\u003C/md-button>\n```\n\nThe default button uses Angular to render markup that looks like this:\n\n```\n\u003Cbutton class=\"md-button md-default-theme\" ng-transclude=\"\">\n    \u003Cspan class=\"ng-binding ng-scope\">Button\u003C/span>\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"md-ripple-container\">\u003C/div>\n\u003C/button>\n```\n\n## A persistent “bug”\n\nThroughout many changes to the framework, there was one issue that came up again and again–sometimes it had a different title, but the underlying problem always smelled the same: _“button stays highlighted after clicking.”_ It came up for buttons, checkboxes, sliders and radio buttons, and people thought it was a mistake in our CSS. Knowing the root cause was the browser and without an obvious solution, I put some [feelers out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/530490701239558144 \"Link opens in a new window\") and got a telling response from Patrick Lauke:\n\n> “Welcome to a world of pain.”\n\nGoogle Chrome, in which (admittedly) most of our users test, clicking with the mouse on a native or custom button does what it should: it sets focus on the element, so hitting TAB will move on to the next focusable element in the DOM. What it shouldn’t do, however, is persist the focus style, be it the browser-default focus ring or a custom background color.\n\n![Animated GIF showing persistent focus on Material Flat Button](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1788596/4944296/49b32bbc-65fc-11e4-91d7-873f0f6a3c95.gif)\n\nFirefox actually gets it right for native buttons: clicking sets focus, but not the visible focus style. Hitting TAB will show the focus style on the _next_ button, since it was an intentional keyboard interaction. Custom `\u003Cdiv>` buttons, on the other hand, suffer the same fate as Chrome. (There's a reason why everyone says _use native buttons_: they're more predictable!)\n\nI could have spent an infinite amount of time checking this in other browsers, but it wouldn't change the fact that Chrome has a perceived bug as far as our users are concerned. A quick search in the [Angular Material Github repo](https://github.com/angular/material \"Link opens in a new window\") turned up 7 related issues, and without a fix duplicates would keep rolling in. So I started experimenting with solutions, knowing all of them would be some kind of hack.\n\nTo see how it was _not_ handled at this point, check out my [Codepen focus sandbox using Angular Material 0.8.3](http://codepen.io/marcysutton/pen/Wvbrvj \"Link opens in a new window\").\n\nI imagined a fix would include detecting whether the user had in fact clicked with the mouse, setting a flag with JavaScript, and only showing keyboard focus if this flag was not present. Obviously, requiring JavaScript to set the correct focus style is…not good. But considering this was for an Angular UI framework, it seemed like a moot point.\n\nI will say that Material Design needs better visual contrast, especially for interactions. It has become very apparent as I've included components in conference talk slides and within my website's design. But that is a separate issue.\n\n## Finding Solutions\n\nIn this post, we'll focus on the fix that went into Angular Material, which uses a single button element. An [alternative version](http://codepen.io/marcysutton/pen/OPveqd \"Link opens in a new window\") required managing two elements (one offscreen) and using ARIA, which was a completely different code smell.\n\nAfter some [experimentation with mdButton](https://github.com/angular/material/pull/1594 \"Link opens in a new window\"), I landed on a solution with JavaScript looking like this:\n\n```\n// restrict focus styles to the keyboard\n    scope.mouseActive = false;\n    element.on('mousedown', function() {\n        scope.mouseActive = true;\n        $timeout(function(){\n          scope.mouseActive = false;\n        }, 100);\n      })\n      .on('focus', function() {\n        if(scope.mouseActive === false) { element.addClass('md-focused'); }\n      })\n      .on('blur', function() { element.removeClass('md-focused'); });\n```\n\n[Angular Material Button Directive Source](https://github.com/angular/material/tree/master/src/components/button \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nIn English: initialize a `mouseActive` \"flag\" variable to `false`. Bind a `mousedown` listener that sets the flag to `true` when a user actually clicks with the mouse, resetting it to `false` after 100 milliseconds. Bind a `focus` listener that checks whether `mouseActive` is `false` and adds an `.md-focused` CSS class. A `blur` event removes the class. This way, the focus style will _only_ be added if the user is truly using the keyboard.\n\nNot exactly related but sort-of, in version 0.9.0 I removed CSS preventing the browser's default focus style on all elements (a blue ring in Chrome). As a UI framework, being this heavy-handed with your CSS is bad for people who use it. You are essentially setting them up to fail with keyboard accessibility, since there is no easy way to add it back (and many won't). In my case, creating sandboxes on Codepen comparing native elements to Angular Material components necessitated this change. Instead, we override the default focus style in each specific component. It felt good to do the right thing as a framework developer, despite a [Github issue questioning the move](https://github.com/angular/material/issues/2404 \"Link opens in a new window\").\n\n## UI heaven…for now\n\nA similar, but slightly more complicated, approach was added to checkboxes and radio buttons. They are more complicated because there are use cases where you might click with the mouse to select something and then use the SPACE bar to activate or deactivate the control. But for buttons, this approach seems to work fine for now. Ideally, Chrome will just fix the bug on the browser side and then we can remove these hacks and await the next version of custom-UI-hell.\n\nNote: relying on NO focus styles to \"fix\" the persistent focus problem does not count as a solution.\n\nHere is an updated [Codepen using Angular Material 0.9.0-rc2](http://codepen.io/marcysutton/pen/WvbrYJ \"Link opens in a new window\") (final release coming soon):\n\n\u003Cscript async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\u003C/script>","src/content/posts/2015-04-25-button-focus-hell.mdx","bee088dd18951f3b","2019-03-12-prototype-testing-accessible-clientside-routing",{"id":837,"data":839,"body":843,"filePath":844,"digest":845,"deferredRender":24},{"title":840,"date":841,"path":842},"Prototype Testing for Accessible Client-Side Routing",["Date","2019-03-12T00:00:00.000Z"],"/prototype-testing-accessible-clientside-routing/","**Update:** In July 2019, I worked with [Fable Tech Labs](https://www.makeitfable.com/) to conduct research on client-side routing and accessibility using the prototypes outlined in this post. You can read the results on the Gatsby blog: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/\n\nA talk on this subject was also done as part of the Inclusive Design 24 conference, and can be viewed online: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tr21FqQQv-U\n\n---\n\nSince the 2019 [CSUN Assistive Technology conference](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2019/sessions/index.php/public/website_pages/view/1), I've been conducting prototype testing with users with disabilities to learn how to best support accessible navigation of [client-rendered websites](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/client-rendered-accessibility/). My goal is to determine common user preferences amongst the many possible techniques: are there any clear winners?\n\nI hope to identify patterns that can influence the JavaScript frameworks and libraries of today, and potentially the web platform APIs of tomorrow. When we pull this off together, we can help to improve accessibility defaults in client-rendered web applications and make a big impact for users across the globe.\n\n## Background\n\nWhen building JavaScript-heavy websites and web applications with popular frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, Ember, Angular and so on, parts of a page can change without a traditional page reload (we call them \"view changes\"). This paradigm requires developers to manually manage focus and screen reader announcements to ensure assistive technology and keyboard-only users aren't left behind while sighted mouse users can follow along. JavaScript \"client-rendering\" of this nature–as opposed to rendering views on the server–requires developers to do some work to create an accessible user experience.\n\nExcept those of us in the community who work with accessibility regularly still can't quite agree on a best practice: should we send focus to a heading, or a wrapper element? Should we announce a page change with [ARIA live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)? Even with tools like [Reach Router](https://github.com/reach/router) for React, which was developed with accessibility in mind, there are still questions about which technique works best. At [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), we're [highly committed](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-18-gatsby-commitment-to-accessibility/) to creating accessible defaults that work for users.\n\nSo I figured, why not take the opportunity to test with users with disabilities at one of the biggest accessibility conferences in the world (CSUN) and beyond? As a web accessibility advocate, I see broad and lasting value in conducting these tests to determine best practices moving forward. Simply put: no matter the framework, we all stand to benefit.\n\n## What are Prototypes?\n\nPrototypes in this case are basic interactive code demos that are mostly identical in content, but differ in user interactions, to test rapidly and provide feedback of what works and what doesn't with minimal investment.\n\nEach prototype has a header describing the example, with a navigation panel and main content area below. When a user clicks on a navigation link, it changes the main content area to show a new \"view\" with a heading and text content. The differences lie in how keyboard focus is handled with JavaScript: where it leaves a keyboard or screen reader user on the page, and what information (if any) is announced in the screen reader.\n\n## Testing objectives\n\nPrototype testing of this nature should 15-30 minutes of your time. Ideally you can pull up [my prototypes](https://marcy.codes/prototypes/routing/) on your own computer and navigate through them, while I take notes and/or record your experience (with permission, of course).\n\nWhat I would like to know:\n\n- Which technique is the most ergonomic and intuitive for you?\n- Do any of the techniques present barriers that detract from your browsing experience?\n\nAs a user with a disability, your participation in this study can help to move the web forward. Your insights are truly valuable in the world of shiny JavaScript web applications, as they can influence implementations in reusable frameworks, UI libraries, and potentially even web standards.\n\n## Let's make it happen\n\nIf you or someone you know is interested in participating in this study, please get in touch with me to set up a time to meet:\n\n- Tweet at me: [@marcysutton](https://twitter.com/marcysutton)\n\nIf you're more interested in providing feedback online than meeting in person, you can also review the prototypes for yourself and then contact me: https://marcy.codes/prototypes/routing/\n\nNo matter your feedback preferences, please [get in touch](https://marcysutton.com/contact/).

And that's before even factoring in your personality or how persuasive you can be.\n\nOver the years, I've noticed that being an \"outsider\" can have a different kind of impact for accessibility. Don't get me wrong, full-time employees do great work for web accessibility and are needed as long-term champions at a company to carry initiatives forward. For my own career direction, though, I've decided that I'll have the best impact by going freelance and consulting with organizations as a trusted outsider. So what are the upsides and downsides to this approach?\n\n## Upsides to being an outsider\n\nMaking a strong first impression as someone who can get to the bottom of accessibility problems can provide opportunities to make change. As a newcomer, you can have fresh perspectives on how work is being done without legacy context clouding the outcomes. As a champion of user experience for accessibility, often this setup can help break through a sentiment of \"but it's always been done this way\". You can push for meaningful change without worrying as much about company politics, though it takes sensitivity to trade-offs and priorities when advocating for solutions to deliver on that strong first impression.\n\nSometimes you'll work with people with sizable egos who pay attention to outside pressure (influential blog posts from the community, competition in the market), and as an outsider you can be in a position to represent those viewpoints in your work. While helpful to have this type of leverage, it also has a downside of not being easy to manage (\"that person said WHAT? BRB, while I figure out what to do next as I shake my head in disbelief\"). This is where persuasion and effective communication can help, especially as you build alliances with full-time employees to make sure you're supporting them in any ways you can.\n\n## What are the downsides?\n\nThere are certainly downsides to being an outsider when working on accessibility, beyond the typical risks of needing to afford health insurance in the US and run a business. You may not have the same level of trust or camaraderie as teams and colleagues do (and you probably won't have as much access), so you'll have to spend time up front gathering information and building relationships. You'll need to keep a high level of professionalism in the face of [friction](https://youtu.be/8bxZuzDKoI0) or adversity, and adjust your approach if things aren't going as intended.\n\nThose egos I mentioned before may also go into toxic workplace territory, which can be extremely stressful to navigate. There may come a point where a project is going poorly enough that you don't want to continue it, in which case you'll need to be careful of contract terms to not make a mess of client relationships (recommended reading: [An Introductory Guide To Business Insurance For Designers And Developers](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/guide-business-insurance-designers-developers/) from Smashing Magazine).\n\n\u003Cp>Aside from personalities and working styles, another thing to keep in mind is that you might not have the same level of ownership over your work as you would in a full-time role. As a consultant, being brought in to work on something for a limited period of time means you won't always have access to it for reference, inspiration, or necessary updates (\"the thing I worked on regressed significantly?? I wish I could fix it \u003Cspan aria-label=\"Weary face\" role=\"img\">😩\u003C/span>\")\u003C/p>\n\nYou might not even be able to talk about your work to the public if you've signed an NDA. If the project is something you're looking to document in a case study for marketing purposes, be sure to talk about it with the client up front.\n\n## No matter your situation, keep the user in mind\n\nWhether you're an outsider/consultant or a full-timer inside a company, making an impact with accessibility is all about keeping users in mind. To be successful at removing barriers to access for users with disabilities, we need to hear their feedback as we develop solutions. Non-disabled people won't have the same experiences, so they need to seek out information from those impacted by inaccessible user interfaces and center their experiences.\n\nIn fostering digital accessibility, everyone needs to work together in setting goals and achieving results: developers can't solve it entirely on our own. We also need disabled perspectives, buy-in from project stakeholders, accessible design thinking, and quality assurance. As outsiders we should be champions of people doing the work internally, so we can have the most effective working relationships. Because we need all the help we can get with accessibility, and we're all in this together.","src/content/posts/2020-09-15-outsider-leverage-accessibility.mdx",[856],"./images/outsider.jpg","27aa2582686140bd","drupalcon",{"id":858,"data":860,"body":864,"filePath":865,"digest":866,"deferredRender":24},{"title":861,"date":862,"path":863,"unlisted":24},"Drupalcon

But 2014 was HUGE. My career exploded in the best of ways. I started traveling internationally to speak at conferences. I became an authority on web accessibility and personally got to know many people I look up to in the industry (quite a few I talk and laugh with almost every day). To capture what an amazing year felt like, I started writing down stats and immediately, in bullet-form, saw why this year meant so much.\n\n- Published original research on [Accessibility and the Shadow DOM](/accessibility-and-the-shadow-dom/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- [Attended my first CSUN](/csun-accessibility-conference-recap/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and made a bunch of friends\n- Saw a nutritionist and a therapist, learned about self-compassion\n- Taught 5 [GDI Seattle](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Seattle/ \"Link opens in a new window\") classes (Intro to HTML & CSS, Intro to JavaScript, Intro to Sass, Intro to jQuery, Web Accessibility)\n- Flew 53,673 miles on 20 travel days\n- Rebuilt [substantial.com](http://substantial.com \"Link opens in a new window\") in Jekyll with a small team\n- Started working on [Angular Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org \"Link opens in a new window\") for accessibility\n- Got a custom [Art Deco shoulder tattoo](http://instagram.com/p/v2Qd9myXtB/ \"Link opens in a new window\") inspired by nature and my love of mountain biking\n- Spoke at 2 meetups and 8 conferences (4 international) and made a bunch of friends\n- [Rode my bike around Paris](http://instagram.com/p/uX-nn-yXqY/ \"Link opens in a new window\") before flying to Louisville, KY for the [Singlespeed Cyclocross World Championships](http://sscxwc14ky.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- Redesigned and built this website in 4 long but fun nights\n- Spent much of my free time studying computer science (still in progress)\n\nIn 2015, my goals are to ride bikes more and study my \"most-hated\" subjects: math and computer science. Although \"most-hated\" isn't really an accurate phrase, because I've been in love with computers [since middle-school](http://instagram.com/p/hRieihyXor/ \"Link opens in a new window\"). It's more that math and new programming languages do not come easy for me. But I know that working hard to catch up on everything I missed while focusing on a career in photojournalism will help me become a more effective software engineer.  At 30 years old, stubborn me finally refuses to accept being bad at math; I'd rather devote the time to getting better at it. I'm already seeing connections between seemingly unrelated subjects, such as math and nature or binary code and braille. Which reminds me, I need a braille business card. I can't go back to [speak at CSUN](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2015/sessions/index.php/public/presentations/view/172 \"Link opens in a new window\") looking like a newb two years in a row!\n\nSo, 2014, thanks for all the things–both good and bad. I'm grateful for life's ups and downs for keeping me energized and challenged. I feel like I'm at the bottom of a mountain looking up sometimes (maybe you feel the same way), but reflecting & appreciating all the good things in life gives you the perspective necessary to keep on charging forward every single day.

I've really come to see the value in writing them down, as they might seem obvious now. But as time passes, inevitably, the details start to fade away. It also feels good to focus on the positive things and hang on to them as we face challenges in our changing world.\n\n![Trail magic in the North Cascades](./trail-magic.jpg)\n\n## What were the biggest changes in your life this year?\n\nIn early January 2016 I left my job on the Adobe Accessibility team to work on accessibility developer tools at Deque Systems (pronounced DQ–say it loud!). This was, of course, after taking some glorious winter time off with my partner in which we fell deeply in love…speaking to the importance of following your heart!\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"flex-row\">\n\n![Cheering with beers on the day I left Adobe, at Route 2 Taproom near Stevens Pass.](./marcy-beers.jpg)![Backcountry skiing in Eastern Oregon](./marcus-backcountry-oregon.jpg)\n\n\u003C/div>\n\nNow, typically I'd prefer to be at a job longer than 6 months–but early into it I found myself unhappy with the projects and admittedly impatient about seeing an impact. I saw \"moving the needle\" at Adobe with my skills and interests potentially taking years to accomplish, yet I needed positive feedback much sooner to feel like I'd done my best work. When I was offered a position at Deque working on product development and evangelism for accessibility, I jumped at the chance.\n\nAlthough working on a small distributed team has its communication challenges, I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing: working on accessibility tools for other developers, writing and speaking about it. The engineering work is very challenging, which I love a lot even though I feel like an imposter sometimes.

I still can't quite believe that is a thing that happened. But there is a reminder sitting on my desk, and I [wrote about it](/oreilly-web-platform-award-omg/) to hang onto those memories. Still, wow.\n\n![Back at SFO and my waterproof bike bag is much heavier! Thanks for the recognition, @oreillymedia! #webPlatform #accessibility #fluentConf](./web-platform-award.jpg)\n\n### Publishing an Accessibility Course\n\nI produced a lot less written content overall in 2016, something I'd like to change next year. But my efforts didn't escape into thin air (even if I spent more time on trails outside and away from the computer): I produced 12 video screencasts as part of an accessibility course for Egghead.io: [Start Building Accessible Web Applications Today](https://egghead.io/courses/start-building-accessible-web-applications-today). It literally took me years from receiving the screencasting equipment from Egghead in fall 2014 to get the lessons out. But they were patient and saw my potential early on, which I appreciate very much! The timeline of this came together with another big change in my life: finally getting a home and dedicated office of my own.\n\n### Leaving the Seattle Rat Race\n\nMy partner Marcus and I like to go out to dinner sometimes and talk about our big dreams. In 2016 we talked a lot about wanting to take longer trips to go skiing, snowboarding, mountain biking and motorcycling; buying property near one of our favorite ski areas; making progress in our careers. We were living together in a house belonging to my family, which had been a safety net for me for the past 4 years as I built my career and financial independence. We frequently talked about city life not being our favorite thing, and I found myself depressed on Saturdays if I hadn't escaped to the mountains.\n\n![Rainier at sunset in the mountains in Eastern Oregon](./rainier-oregon.jpg)\n\nIt was on a trip to Revelstoke, BC in March that it happened–we found our dream house online in Bellingham, WA, and the wheels started turning. What if we combined our dream of owning property near a ski area with the practicality of moving to a smaller city with commerce, breweries, nearby airports and a rad mountain bike trail system? It seemed like a no brainer: ditch the traffic and the restaurants and the tech scene and escape to our new home 20 minutes from Canada and adjacent to our beloved North Cascades mountains. I figured I could always go visit Seattle if I needed a tech or Mom fix, and fly through Bellingham or Vancouver to conferences around the world. And I'm so happy we did.\n\n## Fostering community and relationships\n\nOne of the biggest highlights for me this year was getting a Bellingham visit from my friends Alice Boxhall, Jesse Beach and Ally Lent: the strong accessibility lady crew that I admire so much. The weather was pretty crappy but we made pie and roasted squash, ran around Lake Padden and chased the waning daylight driving up to Mt. Baker. I was so happy to spend quality time together with friends. Thanks again for visiting, ladies!\n\n![Lady friends](./IMG_6615.jpg)\nJesse, Ally, Alice and Marcy on Highway 542 near Mt. Baker\n\nAs I've gotten older I've started to look back at friendships that I let fizzle, and found it much easier to spot new opportunities to kindle relationships. I'm proud that my heart was open enough to make a new lady friend one day on a trail at Galbraith this year (and we went skiing yesterday!), and I also connected with a few amazing ladies here in Bellingham at a women in tech luncheon. Community is so important to remain connected in remote job isolation and to gain perspective from other people. I'll miss Girl Develop It Seattle since I had to resign from chapter leadership to move up here. But I'm cooking up something in 2017 that should provide an opportunity to give back in my new community, too.\n\n## Setting goals and making them happen\n\nWe accomplished our big goal of moving somewhere more remote in 2016 (Bellingham, WA). My partner Marcus is currently working on our next big goal for 2017: an adventure van that will take us to a lifetime of trailheads and mountain passes. I have my sights set on living our best years together, yet it feels like we're already here now. Getting a remote job and moving to be in closer proximity to recreation were the best decisions I ever could have made (sorry, Bay Area!). We'll continue to put energy into our free time passions and let that happiness flow through our lives and careers. Take time off, y'all, it's worth it.\n\nFor work goals in 2017, I want to do more writing and a few more side projects, and start Girl Develop It Bellingham. I'm excited to take energy from our personal life fulfillment to dig deep and produce some of my best work yet. So far I've booked speaking engagements in Utah, San Diego, San Francisco and Barcelona, with more to come. That is a previous life goal come to fruition–I wanted to be a public speaker and I spent the past three years building my life around it. Speaking is absolutely a thing you can do, if the idea gives you butterflies like it did for me.\n\nThanks for listening to me ramble, if you've read this far. :) I'd love to hear about your goals for next year! How are you balancing work and your passions? Any big things you're excited about?\n\n_Happy new year!_","src/content/posts/2016-a-year-of-milestones/index.mdx",[895],"./trail-magic.jpg","03f5319b6d6117cf","2017-in-music",{"id":897,"data":899,"body":905,"filePath":906,"assetImports":907,"digest":909,"deferredRender":24},{"title":900,"date":901,"path":902,"coverImage":903,"homeList":904},"2017, in Music",["Date","2017-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"],"/2017-in-music","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./2017-in-music-1.jpg",false,"If there's one thing I partake in every day that brings me so much comfort and joy, it's music.

Undoubtedly I'll learn new favorites I missed after this post is written, but these are the top 5 I bought and put on repeat.\n\n- ### [Oliver - Full Circle](https://open.spotify.com/album/68Napy7W8wRervbgGRkKP7)\n    \n    \u003Cp>The full-length album from Oliver, _Full Circle_, easily tops my list of favorite albums for 2017. I've had my ear on them for a while, keeping track ever since my sister picked up an instrumental hip hop album by DJ U-Tern in Vancouver. His music evolved into something more dancefloor-heavy, and I can't get enough of it–even it is a little campy at times. My favorite tracks from this album are Heart Attack (with De La Soul), Electrify, and especially, Space and Sound. Looking forward to more from Oliver!\u003C/p>\n    \n    \u003Ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/68Napy7W8wRervbgGRkKP7\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" title=\"Spotify: Oliver, Full Circle\">\u003C/iframe>\n    \n- ### [Nu:Logic – Somewhere Between the Light](https://open.spotify.com/album/6MzcHgrr8goFUrmGdOrKb2)\n    \n    \u003Cp>Nu:tone and Logistics are some of my favorite drum & bass producers, so when I saw they had an album coming out together as Nu:Logic, I pre-ordered it immediately. They definitely didn't disappoint! I really like the songs Strut, Nova, and Our Nights, which they recorded with the Nextmen (another favorite artist of mine).\u003C/p>\n    \n    \u003Ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6MzcHgrr8goFUrmGdOrKb2\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" title=\"Spotify: Nu:Logic, Somewhere Between the Light\">\u003C/iframe>\n    \n- ### [George Fitzgerald - Update](https://open.spotify.com/album/1xrlpryfeOIJyAoUsIPKTn)\n    \n    \u003Cp>This album might be too obscure for some tastes, but I freaking love this one from George Fitzgerald. Especially when I'm hazily traveling through time zones and zoning out in the airport with my headphones on. I learned about this artist from attending the Hotflush showcase at Decibel Festival when I lived in Seattle (RIP). I don't even know how to classify his music, except to say it's electronic and sometimes sounds like house. It's deep and rhythmic, and I'm into it.\u003C/p>\n    \n    \u003Ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1xrlpryfeOIJyAoUsIPKTn\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" title=\"Spotify: George Fitzgerald, Update\">\u003C/iframe>\n    \n- ### [Brother Ali - All the Beauty in this Whole Life](https://open.spotify.com/album/0gFBkSVG8rDireG2Y9JaqI)\n    \n    \u003Cp>Brother Ali is one of my favorite hip hop artists.

In the photojournalism field, you are required to gather details about any subject filling your frame: first and last name, occupation or education, and any other critical details. It’s essential reporting: a photograph without a caption would be an incomplete story.\n\nWhen writing a caption, how much detail is enough for an image? Well, it depends on the image. Some images are used only as space filler, contributing nothing to an article or webpage. They could be marked up in HTML with an empty `alt` attribute and no one would miss anything, because for some reason people pay money to put terrible stock photography into prime online real estate.\n\n[![An extremely awkward stock photo of a lion](./stock-lion.jpg)](http://awkwardstockphotos.com/post/119460646226)\n\nHow does one write a caption for a stock photo? Should you comment on why a grown lion is shredding the gnar on a mountain bike or is it irrelevant to the rest of the webpage? How does a cat shift with no thumbs?\n\nIn comparison, images can also provide important details. A tweet containing only image data could visually present a most hilarious joke or an infographic from the White House showing the current unemployment rate. Without captions, will visually impaired people be able to understand what was in the tweet? What if an image doesn't load–is there any metadata attached about what was in it? Will search engines have to rely on computer vision to caption images where humans with working eyes but out-of-practice empathy muscles didn't do it?\n\nI will admit it takes a disciplined person to always provide detailed captions for image content. I like to think of myself as compassionate and committed to this practice, but even I mess up sometimes, or I'll selfishly tweet something vague where the important detail is in the image. I always come back to wanting to share complete information with all my friends, some of whom are blind or vision-impaired. I don't want to leave them out of jokes or visual delights.\n\nTurns out, writing captions when the information is fresh in your mind not only benefits your friends with disabilities, it can also help you in the future by providing a written record in more detail. In your amazing travel photo, was it a good day? At what bridge did you find that important scene, and what was that local food again? Assembling more of a complete story comes easier when you do it right away, and the text can provide additional data later.\n\n![Dogs in a van on their way to the park, including my dog Wally.](./11154933_716230223118_3831380375912973928_o.jpg)\n\nFor a detailed caption, how much information is “enough”? Let’s look at a photograph I received from my dog walker, Ian, of his group on their way to the park, seen above. My dog Wally stands in the left side of the frame, surrounded by six other dogs. When I shared the photo on Facebook, I tried to write a really good caption. The thing is, an image like this one contains infinite detail: each dog is a different breed, in a certain position, making a face with their eyebrows blowing in one direction, and one is plotting to escape. Colored leashes appear in the foreground with windows in the background looking through to other vehicles and trees. Here’s the caption I wrote at the time, requiring a few edits as I noticed details I'd missed (including an entire dog):\n\n> I can't get enough of this picture of Wally and his pals riding in the van to the park Ian sent me, titled \"Class Photo\". Wally is on the left with his ridiculous eyebrows, beard and scruffy tuxedo, a black lab photobombing in the back, a little brown Chewbacca dog with the cutest face and black feet (stomping in the mud?), a sweet Brittany spaniel who looks like it wants to escape, an extremely photogenic pitt/lab mix (?), and two adorable little brown terriers also with amazing eyebrows—one I almost missed. I'm happy moments like this happen.\n\nI could easily write an essay about how much I love this photograph. But do people want to read all that? Maybe. There’s a balance between writing _enough_ information and _too much_ information. We have to strike the right balance, taking into account our readers’ time as well as ours, as writers. You could spend all day writing the wittiest caption but will the value of the photo balance out the time spent? That better be one hilarious image.\n\nThe medium in which we write also has an impact–it's impossible to jam that much detail into a tweet without relying on 3rd party services, which have their pros and cons. For the visually impaired, services like Easy Chirp fill gaps where the interfaces we use to publish media don't give us the necessary options to share information in more equal formats.\n\nAs content creators, social media butterflies and communicators on planet Earth, we are capable of describing ourselves in more than just the visual sense.

For screen reader users, it's exacerbated: visual content streams in while an auditory progress counter struggles to reach 100% so the page can be consumed.\n\nAs someone who likes fixing user experience problems, I wondered: for all the time and energy spent improving web performance, could we do more to improve the experience for users of assistive technologies (AT) as well?\n\n## A11y and Performance Sitting in a Tree\n\nThe underlying mechanics driving this assistive technology issue came up in an email thread over a year ago amongst some accessibility/web professionals, kind enough to loop me in: George Zamfir, David Newton, Monika Piotrowicz, Henri Helvetica, Alice Boxhall and Tim Kadlec. A really great conversation went around regarding how the accessibility tree works, where the performance slowdowns are in regards to accessibility, and what could be done about it.\n\n[![Email conversation about when the Accessibility Tree is ready](./a11y-perf-convo-1.gif)](https://gist.github.com/marcysutton/13929e9933ad96090817b61d0f921fc8 \"Transcript as Github Gist\")\n\nAfter nearly a year had gone by I kept thinking about the thread, which was filled with interesting accessibility questions and answers from some very thoughtful folks. I asked if anyone had given a technical talk on it so I wouldn't steal anyone's thunder. It turns out they hadn't, so I researched the topic further. What follows is my attempt to add accessibility to the #webperf conversation dominating the mainstream conference circuit.\n\n## Known User Impacts\n\nTwo things I noted right away were **sluggish interactivity for keyboard users** and the **screen reader loading progress** issue mentioned above. Delayed user input because the browser is struggling to download and execute a ton of scripts, styles and resources doesn't just pose an annoyance: users could give up on using your website entirely and never come back!\n\n[![Eevee: Broken areas of Twitter without JS](./eevee-broken-twitter-areas.png)](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/)\n\nI felt validated that this was a problem when I read [Maybe We Could Tone Down the JavaScript](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/) by Eevee, an article that didn't gain me a whole lot of fans in the official Angular Slack channel. In the post, Eevee talks about how bad her experience was with slow-loading interfaces across the web. My takeaway from this: not everyone has a lightning fast connection and a brand new browsing device, and the problems she wrote about were not unique to her. Too often we rely on JavaScript and ARIA to be responsible for creating the entire state of the world when default HTML tags we get would work a lot better (hello, `\u003Cselect>` element). I will come back to this idea with regards to ARIA a little later on.\n\nA keyboard and a screen reader are very closely linked: generally you can't operate a screen reader without a keyboard (I will leave touch devices out of this conversation for now). Therefore, any of the things that impact a dedicated keyboard user will most likely affect a screen reader user, as well: sluggish usability, delayed input, focus being dropped as the page is upgraded with JavaScript. However, there is something unique about the experience for a screen reader user: the fact that accessibility information is derived not only from the Document Object Model but also the [Accessibility Tree](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/01/the-browser-accessibility-tree/), a parallel structure to the DOM kept up-to-date with accessibility information for a given HTML page.\n\n### What impacts the accessibility tree?\n\nI talked with [Marco Zehe](https://www.marcozehe.de) from Mozilla about this subject, and he told me some very interesting things about accessibility in browsers. The tree created from the DOM (and sometimes CSS) changes a lot. When the tree changes, the browser sends events to assistive technology saying a portion of the tree has changed or updated. Making a change to the DOM with JavaScript that causes a [reflow or layout](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/ \"How Browsers Work\") (Gecko and Blink terms for the same thing, respectively) will most likely create or recreate an accessible object for it. ARIA state changes don't recreate objects, but they do send events. Many events are combined together to reduce performance impact: see [Event Coalescing](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/EventCoalescing).\n\n![Gecko Rendering process with Accessibility Tree circled](./geckoflow-ax-tree.png)\n\nThe takeaway is to avoid expensive operations where the browser has to recalculate how to position and display objects in a webpage, such as `display: none;`, `window.getComputedStyle()` and `elem.scrollTop`, to name a few. (A longer list can be found in this [handy gist from Paul Irish](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a).) For accessibility as well as performance, you should limit costly lookups and operations all the time, but especially when a page is loading.\n\nA note on performance metrics: there currently isn't any method for measuring performance of the Accessibility Tree (as far as I know; [here are some ideas from Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/731682736843280384)). Many people have [privacy concerns surrounding accessibility tracking](https://www.marcozehe.de/2014/02/27/why-screen-reader-detection-on-the-web-is-a-bad-thing/), which impacts any conversation on the topic. You could look at the [Navigation Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API) and check when the DOM is interactive and ready, but that only covers the DOM. I would love to see something like \"Accessibility Tree Ready\" in the Navigation Timing API but gaining consensus would be a challenge. I'm also not sure how practical it would be…but as [web performance fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/measure-crp?hl=en) love to say \"you can't optimize what you can't measure\", it would provide us with something interesting!\n\n## Optimizations\n\nOriginally at Fronteers I made 3 recommendations for front-end developers to optimize for accessibility and performance; things I learned after [working on Angular Material](https://marcysutton.com/what-ive-learned-working-on-a-large-open-source-framework/) and years of building websites and web applications:\n\n- Use the browser default HTML elements and CSS wherever possible.\n- Include default ARIA and tabindex values in HTML rendered from the server.\n- Prioritize accessible actions in the [critical rendering path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/?hl=en).\n\nThese were well received except for number 2: for the reasons of [progressive enhancement](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement) and [ARIA rule #1](https://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/#first-rule-of-aria-use), serving `\u003Cmd-checkbox role=\"checkbox\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-checked=\"false\">\u003C/md-checkbox>` gave some people the willies. Although this sample was taken directly from Angular Material, it highlighted two conflicts:\n\n- Use default HTML elements first before using ARIA (contradicting one of my optimizations).\n- A span element with these attributes but no JavaScript to support it would be unusable.\n\nAlthough it was tough to hear that day, I was really grateful to get feedback from [Mallory](https://twitter.com/stommepoes/status/715843693870260224) about NOT setting ARIA defaults in HTML in case JS doesn't load: **eliminating optimization #2**. I had even done a practice run of the talk before and no one mentioned it, however this kind of feedback is very important to listen to. Progressive enhancement, accessibility and web performance are very closely related: they are all about serving the best possible experience to the widest range of people, who sometimes don't have the latest technology or fastest connection.\n\n## Universal/Isomorphic JavaScript\n\nBeing a member of the Angular team for a while meant I was often confronted with an elephant in the room: what if something goes wrong with JS when your entire application depends on it? (see `\u003Cmd-checkbox>` above.) Without client-side JavaScript to load content and bootstrap the UI, users would face a blank screen. When I heard about Universal JavaScript apps (a.k.a. isomorphic JavaScript), despite the \"framework hotness\", I saw real value for accessibility and performance together. With this technique, a JavaScript app is rendered as a complete HTML payload from the server using Node.js, which is then upgraded as client resources download and execute. All of a sudden your Angular app could be usable a lot sooner, even without browser JS. Bells started going off in my head: _\"this could help accessible user experience, too!\"_\n\n![Isomorphic JavaScript: Frameworks, Hotness, Buzzwords](./hotness.gif)\n\nNow, I never thought I'd be in the [Sigh, JavaScript](http://sighjavascript.tumblr.com/) camp, but here we are. I started paying more attention to core functions of websites since the [Air Carrier Access Act](http://www.deque.com/air-carrier-access-act-update/) came about–requiring core functions of airline websites to be accessible–and similarly hoping sites would rely less on JavaScript to deliver EVERYTHING, such as Twitter's tweet detail page or Tumblr's JavaScript-heavy sign-in modal.\n\n_A modal-related tangent: I want to see more default elements such as the native `\u003Cdialog>`, a customizable `\u003Cselect>` or even a tablist in all the major browsers. This would put less of a burden on developers to always reinvent–for example using JavaScript to create custom elements–and help us execute fast, accessible and beautiful web designs using powerful default elements._\n\nAs pioneers of isomorphic JavaScript (for which I will always remember hacking on slides during lunch alongside Spike Brehm at [JSConf 2014](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CH6icJbLhlI)), [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) does good by enabling search as a core function without JavaScript. If JS fails to load, as a user you can still do the most important thing on their site: search for places to rest your weary head. With JS, the full experience is enhanced and you can use the full site. We could argue Airbnb should still do more for non-JS users, but it's better than nothing at all. Every feature has tradeoffs.\n\n![Airbnb search without JavaScript](./airbnb-search-nojs.jpg)\n\nOne promising thing I discovered in researching Universal apps is the [Preboot module by Jeff Whelpley](https://github.com/jeffwhelpley/preboot). Although I had some difficulty keeping up with the many revisions before ng-conf, the promise of Preboot with Angular Universal is that it can track user input before a JavaScript app is fully initialized, replaying anything they typed and keeping track of their focus point in case they tabbed into the page before it fully loaded. I'm excited to see more happen with this module and I hope to see it in other universal app solutions for Ember or React. It is supposed to work with frameworks other than Angular 2, after all. (Just not Angular 1.)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBuilding websites and web applications involves a huge number of tradeoffs, sometimes viciously at odds with each other due to limited time and resources, as well as browser capabilities. For example: \"do we establish a sophisticated online brand or promote accessible user interfaces?\" \"Do we take on the responsibility of building and maintaining core backend services to support no-JavaScript users or make it work better on mobile?\" These are tough decisions to make with competing priorities throughout UX, design and development–before you even factor in requirements from business executives.\n\nFor performance, you will have to compromise how many default HTML widgets you reinvent and restyle, how many assets you load and when, or how much you depend on a JavaScript framework. Each of these concerns can add a significant burden to your users. Try to limit how much you send over the wire, since that cost is very real for each person who visits your site.\n\nDon't forget that people rely on keyboards and assistive technologies to interact with the Web. They need [basic accessibility support](https://marcysutton.com/how-i-audit-a-website-for-accessibility/) before you even get to performance tuning.

This post was migrated from its original location on the [Substantial](http://substantial.com) blog._\n\n## tl;dr\n\nWeb Components, including Shadow DOM, are accessible because assistive technologies encounter pages _as rendered,_ meaning the entire document is read as “one happy tree”. With a polyfill to add broader support, users with modern browsers can interact with Web Components using a keyboard, touch or mouse. Screen readers will also read the page aloud, illustrating how Shadow DOM fits seamlessly into the regular DOM.\n\nIt’s easy: to make Web Components accessible to all users, write accessible code.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIf you’re like me and you have an interest in cutting-edge technology, you may have heard about the emerging standards capturing the attention of web developers. Web Components are a group of new technologies aimed at encapsulating related styles and scripts together in separate containers to minimize conflicts with the rest of a document, similar to the approach of an iframe. There are multiple parts to the [Web Components specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/ \"Link opens in a new window\") working their way through the W3C and into a few browsers. Official descriptions from the W3C:\n\n- [Templates](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/#template-section \"Link opens in a new window\") define chunks of markup that are inert but can be activated for use later.\n- [Decorators](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/#decorator-section \"Link opens in a new window\") apply templates based on CSS selectors to affect rich visual and behavioral changes to documents.\n- [Custom Elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/#custom-element-section \"Link opens in a new window\") let authors define their own elements, with new tag names and new script interfaces.\n- [Shadow DOM](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/#shadow-dom-section \"Link opens in a new window\") encapsulates a DOM subtree for more reliable composition of user interface elements.\n- [Imports](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/#imports-section \"Link opens in a new window\") define how templates, decorators and custom elements are packaged and loaded as a resource.\n\nThis group of technologies has potential to radically change how web applications are built and bring them more in line with traditional object-oriented software engineering, i.e. modular, encapsulated components with well-defined interfaces.\n\nGiven my interest in web accessibility, I was curious how custom Web Components might impact user experience with [assistive technologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology \"Link opens in a new window\"), in particular screen readers. Because of its effect on the [DOM](http://www.w3.org/DOM/ \"Link opens in a new window\") (Document Object Model), the portion of the spec that I wondered about most was Shadow DOM. It was also my first introduction to Web Components.\n\nIn this article, I’ll dive in to the accessibility implications of Shadow DOM and shine some light on the current situation.\n\n## Why accessibility?\n\nIf we’re talking about a new approach to building websites, isn’t it important that everyone can access them? The “accessibility community” has traditionally referred to persons with disabilities, such as blindness or low vision, deafness, hard-of-hearing, motor or cognitive impairments. There is a growing belief, however, that making something accessible means that _everyone_ can use it: your customers, your Mom, even you (in the future).\n\n## Enter the Shadow DOM\n\nWhat’s interesting about Shadow DOM in particular is that browser makers have been using it right under our noses for quite some time to style elements without affecting web standards: HTML tags such as textarea, input and the HTML5 video element all contain child elements “hidden” behind a Shadow DOM boundary. We can just now start to see evidence of this technique in the greater web ecosystem when inspecting elements in browsers that support this feature, such as the latest versions of Chrome (after [toggling the option in Settings](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/settings \"Link opens in a new window\")) and [Firefox Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\").\n\n![Video tag screenshot](./video-shadow-dom.png) _Pictured: HTML5 video tag with “Show Shadow DOM” enabled in Chrome Developer Tools_\n\n## How could people use it?\n\nTo connect the possibility of using this shiny, obscure technology to real(ish)-world scenarios, there was [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), a pre-alpha project by Google, containing [polyfills](http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/ \"Link opens in a new window\") that broadened compatibility of Web Components to [“evergreen” browsers](http://www.yetihq.com/blog/evergreen-web-browser/ \"Link opens in a new window\"): IE10+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and a couple of mobile browsers (see [compatibility matrix](https://www.polymer-project.org/resources/compatibility.html \"Link opens in a new window\")).\n\nThere wasn’t much in the way of website analytics for screen readers due to privacy concerns and most assistive technology software being system-installed applications. I _was_ able to refer to the [WebAIM Screen Reader Survey](http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/ \"Link opens in a new window\") to assess browser and screen reader preferences as reported by users (there is also a [new version](http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey5/ \"Link opens in a new window\") coming any day now). In terms of screen readers, JAWS, Window-Eyes and VoiceOver were the most widely used. For browsers, I knew there was a lot of Internet Explorer 8 and below, some Firefox and less Chrome—I’m still curious about what we’ll see in this year’s survey.\n\n## Initial thoughts about Shadow DOM access\n\nWhen I first heard about Shadow DOM, given that I’m not a browser implementer, I had some questions. Would there be any noticeable difference for assistive technology when encountering content in the Shadow DOM versus the regular DOM? Was there anything about the nature of encapsulation that would cause trouble for assistive technologies? An older [HTML5Rocks article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/ \"Link opens in a new window\") by Web Components spec editor Dominic Cooney mentioned that “you shouldn’t put _content_ in Shadow DOM” because it would be inaccessible to a screen reader or search engine. Was this true?\n\nIn my initial research, I found a [Web Components article](http://css-tricks.com/modular-future-web-components/ \"Link opens in a new window\") with a brief mention of accessibility as well as example components that didn’t work with a keyboard. “Uh oh”, I thought…will we be able to navigate the Shadow DOM with keyboards? This article led me to the only post at the time wholly devoted to the topic: Steve Faulkner at the Paciello Group had written about [Web Components and ARIA](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2012/07/notes-on-web-components-aria/ \"Link opens in a new window\") back in 2012. His findings were that “screen readers can access content in Shadow DOM without issue.” This was also confirmed by a short post on the [Polymer FAQ](https://www.polymer-project.org/resources/faq.html#accessibility \"Link opens in a new window\"):\n\n> “A common misconception is that the Shadow DOM doesn’t play nicely with assistive technologies. The reality is that the Shadow DOM can in fact be traversed and any node with Shadow DOM has a shadowRoot property which points to its shadow document. Most assistive technologies hook directly into the browser’s rendering tree, so they just see the fully composed tree.”\n\n## How Do Screen Readers Interact With a Browser?\n\nResearch into the accessibility of Shadow DOM provided great news for everyone moving forward. Still, I wondered how a screen reader could access content that was supposed to be encapsulated from the rest of a document. I hadn’t previously researched the [internals of a browser](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), so the concept of a DOM tree versus a rendering tree was new to me. I’m still learning how browsers work, but I did find some good information about assistive technology and Shadow DOM.\n\nAccording to section 7.5 of the [Shadow DOM spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/ \"Link opens in a new window\"):\n\n> “User agents with assistive technology traverse the [document tree](http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/#dfn-document-tree \"Link opens in a new window\") as rendered, and thus enable full use of [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/ \"Link opens in a new window\") semantics in the [shadow trees](http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/#dfn-shadow-tree \"Link opens in a new window\").”\n\n![Bob Ross meme let's paint a happy little tree](./bob-ross3.jpg) \n\nThe “as rendered” part of that statement highlights the fact that screen readers encounter source code after it has been manipulated with JavaScript and CSS, similar to what’s visible in the Chrome or Firefox Developer Tools (as compared to View Source, which is pre-render). That made sense considering screen readers are affected by JavaScript and some CSS properties. When Shadow DOM nodes, or subtrees, are appended to a parent document, they are read aloud as “one happy tree” to a screen reader.\n\n## Hands-on research\n\nIn addition to reading everything I could about Shadow DOM and accessibility, from [mailing lists](http://w3-org.9356.n7.nabble.com/Feedback-and-questions-on-shadow-DOM-and-web-components-td62214.html \"Link opens in a new window\") to [blog posts](http://www.sitepoint.com/dark-shadow-dom/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), I furthered my research by creating custom components and testing different scenarios.\n\n### Keyboards\n\nThe first thing I wanted to test was whether the Shadow DOM was navigable by keyboard—I was thrown off the trail by inaccessible widget examples on [CSS-Tricks.com](http://css-tricks.com/modular-future-web-components/ \"Link opens in a new window\")—to find out, I created a [test page on Github](http://github.com/marcysutton/web-components-accessibility-sandbox/ \"Link opens in a new window\") containing a custom drop-down widget and a button that I knew were keyboard-active in the regular DOM and injected them into the page via the Shadow DOM.\n\nAfter learning a ton about registering elements, creating callbacks, template tags and [new CSS properties](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom-201/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), I found that the Shadow DOM _IS_ navigable by keyboard. D’oh! Of course it would be, I thought—wouldn’t browser makers have keyboard users’ backs? Not necessarily, as shown by the [HTML5 video tag](http://terrillthompson.com/blog/366 \"Link opens in a new window\"), but in this case, the mouse-enabled controls in the CSS Tricks examples weren’t accessible via the keyboard no matter if they were in the Shadow DOM.\n\nOn my [test page](http://marcysutton.github.io/web-components-accessibility-sandbox/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), the Shadow DOM drop-down and button widgets were fully keyboard accessible and responded to the same input as their regular DOM counterparts. This was great news for keyboard users!\n\n### Screen Readers\n\nThe next thing I wanted to test was how a screen reader interacted with the Shadow DOM. I got demo copies of [JAWS 15](http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/jaws/jaws-downloads.asp \"Link opens in a new window\") and [Window Eyes](http://www.gwmicro.com/Window-Eyes/Demo/ \"Link opens in a new window\") set up on [Virtual Box](http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads \"Link opens in a new window\"), in addition to [VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/ \"Link opens in a new window\") on Mac. Since Polymer only extended compatibility as far back as IE10, I kept my test suite intentionally small, but testing could easily extend to older screen readers and mobile browsers with more time. I added Polymer’s platform.js to shim in basic support for Web Components in browsers besides Chrome, leaving out their larger component library in favor of my own implementation.\n\nI had seen mentioned in a few places that “content should be kept out of the Shadow DOM” and only “presentation-related divs” should be used. I also heard that people on the Internet [_really love tacos_](https://twitter.com/hopefulcyborg/status/426819806436679680 \"Link opens in a new window\"). So to test the accessibility of Shadow DOM in a screen reader, I created a `\u003Ctaco-article>` component containing a heading, link and paragraphs that I knew were accessible in the regular DOM, as well as a button with text replaced by Shadow DOM content to see what was read aloud. Lastly, I emulated a name-tag example in Dominic Cooney’s [Shadow DOM article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/ \"Link opens in a new window\") to see if the new `\u003Ccontent>` tag read correctly.\n\n![Web Component screenshot](./tacocat-screen-shot.png) _Pictured: Name tag example shows text rendered in Shadow Root, projected via `\u003Ccontent>`. The heading is read as “Tacocat, Heading Level 4.”_\n\nIn IE10, I wanted to see what happened without compatibility support so I intentionally disabled Polymer. Surprisingly, my drop-down widgets that were included via `\u003Ctemplate>` tags _just worked_. But they weren’t supposed to—IE hasn’t even hinted at supporting Shadow DOM (other than [this post about Canvas](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh968259(v=vs.85).aspx \"Link opens in a new window\")). Upon looking in the F12 Developer Tools, I found that instead of throwing an error, the template tag was treated as a regular div and my widget was instantiated in the regular DOM. Oops! I added some CSS to my reset stylesheet to hide the template tag, and then it behaved more like normal: no Shadow DOM widget. So I reenabled Polymer, and voilà! Shadow DOM-enabled elements became visible in IE10.\n\nWhen I enabled JAWS, I found that every piece of content on the page read correctly, no matter if it was in the regular DOM or the Shadow DOM. JAWS respected heading levels and navigation and had absolutely no trouble reading the entire page. A really interesting example was a name tag with text projected into a `\u003Ccontent>` placeholder that appears empty in the Developer Tools (see screenshot above). Pre-render, it only contained the word “Nyan”. After being initialized with additional content from a Shadow DOM template, a name tag was rendered. JAWS then read the complete heading: “Tacocat, Heading level 4.” It said the word funny, but it was otherwise accurate!\n\nWindow-Eyes in Firefox for PC had some trouble navigating my taco-article at first, but it just seemed buggy—the summary would skip over it, but hovering on it would read all of the content. When I added the same article to the regular DOM for comparison, both versions started being read aloud. I then reverted to just the Shadow DOM taco-article and it started reading correctly in the page summary. Chalking that one up to user error. Window Eyes in Firefox seemed to work just fine.\n\nLastly, I checked the sandbox in Voiceover for Mac. Besides its inability to correctly say the word _taco_, I experienced normal behavior when reading headings, links, buttons, interactive widgets and text replaced via the Shadow DOM.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nIn conducting these experiments, I learned many different things:\n\n- Screen readers encounter one happy, rendered tree when reading a page containing Shadow DOM.\n- New standards are developed by people—there are problems and bugs that must be addressed over time, with help from the community. Shadow DOM may have had issues at one time, but implementers have [made sure](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=234502 \"Link opens in a new window\") it could be accessed by everyone. The coolest part is that we as developers can _participate_ in the creation of new technologies.\n- JAWS and Window Eyes have free demo versions that are perfect for testing.\n- The Cat and Hat CSS selectors are [not yet supported in SASS](https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/1071 \"Link opens in a new window\").\n- Native HTML5 video controls, a Shadow DOM implementation, are [only keyboard accessible in Internet Explorer](http://terrillthompson.com/blog/366 \"Link opens in a new window\"). Who knew?\n\nBut, most importantly, I learned that the **same accessibility problems exist no matter what kind of DOM you create**. Allow users to interact without a mouse and provide readable content that’s more than just visual. For basic accessibility tips, refer to the [A11YProject](http://a11yproject.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\") or [WebAIM](http://webaim.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\").\n\nFinally, any good project wouldn’t be complete without questions for further research. Among them:\n\n- What about nested Shadow DOMs? Multiple shadows on one shadow host?\n- Are there any quirks with tab index on multiple Web Components in a page?\n- What are some best practices for styles and scripts when creating Web Components?\n- Does Shadow DOM usage have any SEO implications?\n- Why aren’t HTML5 video controls keyboard accessible in Chrome or Firefox?\n\nI look forward to answering these questions and seeing new technologies advance their way into our daily projects. I’m very encouraged by the passion my fellow developers have for asking questions and pushing the Web forward. Its future is bright!","src/content/posts/accessibility-and-the-shadow-dom/index.mdx",[944],"./bob-ross3.jpg","9cf72564d15a7d74","accessibility-is-a-civil-right",{"id":946,"data":948,"body":953,"filePath":954,"assetImports":955,"digest":957,"deferredRender":24},{"title":949,"date":950,"path":951,"coverImage":952},"Accessibility is a Civil Right",["Date","2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z"],"/accessibility-is-a-civil-right","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./tolerance-crop.png","![A handshake with words overlaid: Respect, communicate, tolerate, collaborate, serve, connect, unite us](./tolerance-crop.png)\n\nOn Martin Luther King, Jr. Day this year, amidst a giant shift in U.S. politics and societal norms, I want to take a moment to discuss accessibility as a civil right, something I learned from disability rights attorney [Lainey Feingold](http://www.lflegal.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\"). Starting with inspiration from [The King Center](http://www.thekingcenter.org/meaning-king-holiday \"Link opens in a new window\"):\n\n> Every King Holiday has been a national “teach-in” on the values of nonviolence, including unconditional love, tolerance, forgiveness and reconciliation, which are so desperately-needed to unify America. It is a day of intensive education and training in Martin’s philosophy and methods of nonviolent social change and conflict-reconciliation. The Holiday provides a unique opportunity to teach young people to fight evil, not people, to get in the habit of asking themselves, “what is the most loving way I can resolve this conflict?”\n\nLet's be real: despite 8 years of inclusive U.S. leadership under Barack Obama, upon Inauguration Day 2017, it feels now as if we have gone backwards as a species. It's an ugly scene out there for many groups of people in our current political climate. However, we have Dr. King to thank for giving us enduring inspiration for moving forward in spite of the ugliness and evil in the world.\n\nWhile most widely remembered for his efforts toward racial equality and economic justice, Dr. King pushed forward the values of unconditional love and tolerance for all people. He was also an advocate of performing service for others. We can take in this philosophy of acceptance and give empathy back to the world in many ways.\n\nTake accessibility, for example: the design and development of inclusive spaces for all people, but especially those with disabilities. Many of our fellow humans are locked out of digital and real-life experiences due to barriers they cannot overcome. If you are a web designer or developer concerned about making a difference and putting your values to work, you have an opportunity to remove barriers to access and provide people with more independence.\n\nYou can support diverse people–including people with disabilities–by hiring diverse teams. Incorporate their [user stories](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/user-story \"Link opens in a new window\") in your work. Apply inclusive values on the Web by improving visual contrast, building in support for keyboards and screen readers, providing captions and media transcripts, simplifying language and localizing content. Making accessibility improvements to further our users' civil rights can improve the Web for people of all abilities, across the world, by removing barriers and providing features everyone can use.\n\nI'm proud to work for [Deque Systems](http://www.deque.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), a company whose mission is, simply, _digital equality_. There are other great companies pushing accessibility forward, too. Knowing there are other humans out there standing up for diversity and inclusion gives me comfort at a difficult time. I refuse to accept the \"forget you, I got mine\" culture going around, and I encourage you to do the same. By applying values of love and acceptance at work and in life every single day, we can make a difference.\n\n_Thank you to Brian Kardell for input on this post._","src/content/posts/accessibility-is-a-civil-right/index.mdx",[956],"./tolerance-crop.png","6e44ff8a934c0afb","accessibility-jobs-specialized-mainstream",{"id":958,"data":960,"body":965,"filePath":966,"assetImports":967,"digest":969,"deferredRender":24},{"title":961,"date":962,"path":963,"coverImage":964},"Finding accessibility jobs in specialized companies and the mainstream",["Date","2020-10-12T00:00:00.000Z"],"/accessibility-jobs-specialized-mainstream/","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./csun.jpg","_Updated November 25, 2022_\n\n![Me presenting on the Deque Systems stage at the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference](./csun.jpg)\n\nIn the field of web development, having accessibility expertise can set you apart from other candidates. I see a lot of questions about jobs from people with a passion for accessibility and inclusive design, so I wrote this blog post to share insights I’ve formed over 11 years of working in the digital accessibility community (13 years as a full-time web developer in total).\n\nIn contrast to my last post on making an impact as an independent [“accessibility outsider”](/outsider-leverage-accessibility/), this one is about working full-time in a job with digital accessibility tasks in some fashion. You have some decisions to make about the type of company you work for and the type of role. My aim is to help you ask the right questions and set up your career for success.\n\n_Note: a talk of mine for A11yNYC covered some of these career development aspects, you can catch the replay including Q&A on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExNPlxmuwBE_\n\n## Deciding on a company\n\nTo work on digital accessibility full-time, you have quite a few options when it comes to deciding on a company. This post is focused on comparing accessibility-specific companies to mainstream companies, since that’s where my experience has been–but there are also accessibility opportunities in governmental organizations, higher-education, and nonprofits to consider.\n\nYou could work on accessibility at a startup, a small, medium, or large-sized company. Enterprises tend to have enterprise-level concerns, where you’d work to move a big ship through lots of potential red tape but also have a gigantic accessibility impact. At a startup it might be easier to move fast and (hopefully not) break things, but you’ll have less of the necessary checks and balances for long term quality. Your experience and ability to make a lasting impact will vary.\n\nPicking which type of company is right for you will be a deeply personal decision based on the opportunity, your experience, career direction, personality, and network connections. It could also really depend on who’s hiring when you're looking for a job. Do you want to work with a range of clients as a subject matter expert, or on a product full time? Do you want to work on the front-end for a product that the general public will use, or accessibility tools for industry professionals?\n\nWhat is the team, organization, and work culture like? Are there power dynamics at play which can impact your ability to advocate for access and product quality?\n\n### Upsides and downsides of accessibility companies\n\nAccessibility-specific companies like Deque Systems, TPGi, and Level Access are focused for the most part on selling accessibility services and testing products. A really great part of working at an accessibility company is you can learn a lot from industry leaders through internal discussions about accessibility matters like understanding and applying WCAG, global legal ramifications, and techniques for auditing and remediating accessibility issues. You can also gain valuable accessibility network connections for the future. You’ll very often find alignment about accessibility’s importance at the company, so you’ll spend less time trying to convince colleagues to do the right thing.\n\nAccessibility companies are a small world. Many of us have worked with each other and seen folks switch from one company to another for various reasons. There are  success stories and a wide range of opportunities from UX/Design to Software Engineering, Management, and QA. Some folks work on web, mobile, and accessibility standards. However, there are also less glowing company reviews.\n\nDespite the upside of an accessibility-aligned workplace, these companies can have potential downsides causing employees to compromise other values: diversity, psychological safety, the ability to make contributions without hearing “stay in your lane”. Toxic leadership can drive good people out of any type of company, sure. But it’s better to know the full picture when forming your impression of a “do good” working environment.\n\nMy advice is to interview people who work there currently and have worked there in the past to know what the culture is like. See some bonus questions at the end of this post for techniques on sniffing out problems in the interview stage.\n\n### Making an impact on accessibility at “mainstream” companies\n\nMy working definition of a mainstream company is one whose mission does not specifically include accessibility. It could land anywhere on the spectrum of “we don‘t do anything for accessibility” to “we’re pretty proactive about it”, as a whole or in small pockets.\n\nIf you have the right support system and culture, working at a mainstream company can be a big accessibility opportunity. You could work on sites, frameworks, and products that impact thousands of users with disabilities. You could contribute to a product’s accessibility over time and potentially* take ownership of the results: great experience to put on your resumé. You might also have higher pay and better benefits. Perhaps these things could become leverage in negotiations with an accessibility company should you have two competing offers.\n\nSome mainstream companies may already have accessibility specialists or teams, and hopefully those specialists aren‘t [volunteers like Twitter up until two years ago](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers). Without company alignment or accountability for accessibility you might find yourself fighting hard and encountering a lot of friction and red tape to do the right thing for users. (Like Twitter currently, whose accessibility team was [let go under problematic new ownership](https://time.com/6230469/disability-users-twitter-elon-musk/).) It‘s frustrating as a champion to see products and sites launched or maintained without accessibility. It harms people with disabilities, first and foremost. But it can also lower your trust in a company and a lack of agency can contribute to burnout over time.\n\nIn mainstream companies you might encounter more friction when trying to make something accessible. There may be reluctance to enable accessibility lint rules because they're misunderstood, or choices made in frontend architecture that disregard the latest user feedback even with concerns brought to their attention. You might be brushed off when pushing for accessibility to be included in a _definition of done_ or have to wait for the next sprint. This is a painful way to work when you see design and technical debt piling up among your peers.\n\nAccessibility efforts at mainstream companies can definitely work, though. There are many potential allies across the company you could befriend to foster an accessibility culture. Create an accessibility guild and have recurring hangouts. Push for accessibility in onboarding, product development, documentation, and training. Nudge HR, Operations, and Legal teams to procure and build accessible software products for an inclusive workplace. As a lone expert you may miss out on meaningful peer review of your accessibility work, so this building up of an inclusive culture could alleviate that over time as institutional expertise grows.\n\n*On potentially taking ownership of results: this will really depend on your role. Is accessibility part of your official job duties or something you’re doing on the side? Be careful not to get stuck in a position where your efforts go unappreciated or reflected in performance reviews, as that can be a dead end or path to bad times.\n\n## Deciding on an accessibility role\n\nYou can bring passion and expertise for accessibility to any role, and in fact we need it represented across the industry to truly move the needle for people with disabilities.\n\n### Accessibility client-service roles\n\nCommon roles in full-time digital accessibility include Accessibility Specialists / Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who audit and remediate websites and applications through service agreements. These folks are the bread and butter of accessibility companies as they pull in a bunch of revenue from clients. Automated tools only wish they could be as nuanced and accurate as these compassionate human computers are.\n\nI personally never opted for an accessibility SME role even though I had the deep technical and design knowledge required because I don’t particularly enjoy the process of auditing and filling out spreadsheets or JIRA. I’ve also heard SME friends say they’ve felt their development skills atrophy, so for anyone wanting to stay technical you should ask about specific job duties in an interview. How much of a role is research vs. development will vary, but accessibility specialists are usually not coders full-time. It really helps to be a technical SME though, as you can make more informed recommendations and prototypes with working code to keep your skills sharp and provide customer value.\n\nAs a SME at an accessibility company you may get to work with big-name, mainstream clients and therefore have an opportunity to make an impact on the lives of thousands of people with disabilities. But you might also have less ownership over a project, and feel like you have less to show for your experience in the end–especially if you’ve had to sign an NDA or something and are unable to share your work in a portfolio.\n\n### Accessibility product and advocacy roles\n\nThere are also roles dedicated to the creation of accessibility products including public speaking and advocacy. In my experience as an accessibility evangelist and engineer, niche companies and accessibility testing products [don't typically have the same reach as the mainstream](/encouraging-contributions-with-docs). Look at GitHub stars for industry tools: accessibility tooling has a fraction of the popularity as mainstream tools unless bundled with something else (like eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y). It’s also a crowded market with new accessibility tools popping up all the time, often for free. To stay competitive, it’s important to have supportive leadership that enables experiments from anyone at the company with an idea, as well as acting on user feedback in a timely manner.\n\n## Accessibility and persuasion\n\nWhether you’re at a mainstream company or an accessibility company with mainstream clients, not everyone will understand or appreciate the need for accessibility so you’ll have to persuade them of its importance and feasibility with risk assessments and estimates. Occasionally you’ll want to “stay late and do the work anyway” to actually make an impact, and hopefully you’ll be rewarded for it–but you might not.\n\nSome techniques I’ve found that can work for being persuasive are highlighting quick wins, coming to the table with suggestions and estimates for how to fix within a reasonable scope, and adjusting your approach for specific personalities and roles (are they more inclined to care about risk/legal management or technical debt and cost?). You can experiment with “the carrot vs. the stick”: using kindness when it works and making friends with the legal/compliance team for when that isn’t cutting it.\n\nUse feedback to your advantage: surface accessibility issues to PMs and leadership as leverage to get time to work on it. Celebrate wins by collecting positive feedback as confirmation that accessibility is worth it, especially from users with disabilities. Find ways to get user feedback if it doesn’t already exist. Add an [accessibility statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/) to request feedback, get leadership invested and involved.\n\n## Setting yourself up for success\n\nIf you’re considering a new role in accessibility–no matter the type of company–it would be very worthwhile to interview people who work there currently and have worked there in the past to uncover things like:\n\n*   How does the company make their money, and does accessibility factor into that?\n*   What’s the best part about working there?\n*   What’s the worst part about working there?\n*   What does a day in the life of someone in this role look like?\n*   How is disability representation, diversity, and inclusion at the company?\n*   How competitive are the pay and benefits?\n*   For product development, what’s the tech stack like?\n*   How are product decisions made; who has the final say?\n*   What kind of friction do people encounter in their jobs?\n\nMarketing yourself as an accessibility specialist can open doors to opportunities all across the tech industry. Identify what’s important to you in terms of values, so you can ask about those things in interviews. To showcase your work, highlight examples of problems you’ve enjoyed solving (including side projects), and what skills you contributed that you could bring to your next team. What do you want to do more of? What kind of work would help you shine as an accessibility specialist, and what have you done so far that can make someone confident in hiring you?","src/content/posts/accessibility-jobs-specialized-mainstream/index.mdx",[968],"./csun.jpg","e12bf5823b0e4a6e","accessibility-wins",{"id":970,"data":972,"body":977,"filePath":978,"assetImports":979,"digest":981,"deferredRender":24},{"title":973,"date":974,"path":975,"coverImage":976},"Accessibility Wins",["Date","2015-04-10T00:00:00.000Z"],"/accessibility-wins","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./a11ywins-2-1024x756.jpg","In 2015, I started writing for [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), a platform for web creators that gives you a bunch of random publish dates and the freedom to write about whatever you want. I jotted down ideas to make writing in the coming months easier, so I wouldn't have it looming over me. A few of those ideas were:\n\n- _Ways we could help people with the Web (dream big)_\n- _How can we get more people to care about accessibility?_\n- _Being patient vs. being loud_\n- _Riding a bike to an accessibility conference_\n\nThat last one I decided to [write first](/riding-a-bicycle-to-an-accessibility-conference/), since it was about the upcoming CSUN conference. My next publish date wasn't until April 26, but it was really comforting knowing that I had other ideas written down.\n\nWhen it came time to start writing my second Pastry Box post, I looked through my list and decided to go with _Being patient vs. being loud_. It just seemed like something I could write about in that moment. So, I started writing down bullet points, my typical writing process. My first few bullet points looked like this:\n\n- _Tension between pointing out accessibility failures and waiting for things to get fixed_\n- _I really wish there were more accessibility wins to showcase. Less Debbie Downer, more Happy Hippo?_\n- _Maybe I’ll just start a Tumblr. But people will need to send me stuff!_\n\n![Accessibility Wins](./a11ywins-2-1024x756.jpg)\n\nI stopped writing and went over to Tumblr, thinking, _this could be a cool experiment._ I decided to [create a blog](https://a11ywins.tumblr.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\") showcasing good accessibility. I had quite a few examples to start, but I also reached out to my network on Twitter and got some responses, most of which were about native mobile applications.\n\nAdmittedly, native app toolkits make it easier to get accessibility right, so that's why those apps are used more frequently by people with disabilities ([related article by Marco Zehe](https://www.marcozehe.de/2012/12/10/why-do-native-mobile-apps-seem-to-win-all-the-time/ \"Link opens in a new window\")). But I knew the audience was going to be Web people, so I wanted the blog to showcase Web stuff. I wanted to encourage building accessibility into the Web because projects built for it can be made to last, working across multiple platforms. Mobile web accessibility might be hard right now, but I want us to make it better.\n\nI hacked at a Tumblr theme for a day or two to make more it accessible by adjusting the heading structure, adding labels to icon buttons, adding link text underlines and focus styles. I posted a few things, focusing on a positive point of view. When I was ready (and I replaced my laptop that went down thanks to a clumsy cup of water), I [let Twitter know](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/582418630844891137 \"Link opens in a new window\") about the blog, [_Accessibility Wins_](https://a11ywins.tumblr.com \"Link opens in a new window\").\n\nWithin an hour, it started taking off. People were _really_ clamoring for accessibility examples with a positive spin. Some very nice people said nice things, including:\n\n- “Now that’s using Tumblr for good.”\n- “Accessibility, the missing showcase.”\n- “We don’t celebrate the good stuff enough. This rocks.”\n- “Please tell me again that you have to choose between an awesome UI and Accessibility.”\n- “Digging a11ywins and its positive point of view. Drawing attention to well-built, accessible interfaces.”\n- “Finally and much-needed.”\n- “Accessibility Wins is a goldmine!\n\nTaking a cue from [WTFMobileWeb](http://wtfmobileweb.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\") by Brad Frost, I created a page for you to submit wins in web accessibility–stuff you've seen or worked on yourself. I've gotten a few, but I [always need more](https://a11ywins.tumblr.com/submit \"Link opens in a new window\")–good accessibility is hard to find. I am especially looking for mobile responsive web examples, which is even more challenging. I have faith we can find them (or make them!).\n\nIn a very short week, Accessibility Wins gained 850 followers on Tumblr, mentions in Smashing Magazine, CSS Tricks and SidebarIO, and so many tweets I need an analytics service to count them all (thank you!). I've never launched that successful of a project, and it's all thanks to you for reading and sharing it.\n\nAccessibility Wins told me that people want to learn about accessibility when it comes with a positive point of view (actually hitting two of my Pastry Box bullet points). No one wants to be shamed and told they're doing it wrong…it's just not an effective strategy. I learned this myself in the past year, and I cringe at how loud I was with my pitchfork, at times.\n\nIn my [next Pastry Box article](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/marcy-sutton/2015-april-20), I wrote about the tension between being loud and being patient. There are times when speaking up is necessary, but we need people to want to work with us for the real change to happen. Because there are _people_ building the sites we use, just like you or me. I want to believe we can do better with the right encouragement.","src/content/posts/accessibility-wins/index.mdx",[980],"./a11ywins-2-1024x756.jpg","fcf375bd995b3e51","angular-protractor-accessibility-plugin",{"id":982,"data":984,"body":989,"filePath":990,"assetImports":991,"digest":993,"deferredRender":24},{"title":985,"date":986,"path":987,"coverImage":988},"Protractor Accessibility Plugin",["Date","2015-03-05T00:00:00.000Z"],"/angular-protractor-accessibility-plugin","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./protractor-tenon-no-shadow.png","Automated testing is a valuable tool for identifying common accessibility issues with a minimum amount of effort. As part of my work on the Angular core team, I got to spend a week and a half writing an accessibility plugin for [Protractor](http://protractortest.org \"Link opens in a new window\"), the end-to-end testing framework for [Angular](http://angular.io \"Link opens in a new window\"). It ended up being super awesome that Julie Ralph, the lead developer on Protractor, works in the Google Seattle office because we were able to pair in person a few times which helped me out a LOT. Julie created the plugin architecture and hooks I needed to integrate Protractor with accessibility auditing tools.\n\n![Protractor Tenon example](./protractor-tenon-no-shadow.png)\n\nProtractor output on the console\n\nAs an accessibility specialist and developer, I was in a good position to make decisions about how the testing should work in Protractor. I looked at a ton of accessibility testing solutions, including the basic [React-a11y](https://github.com/rackt/react-a11y \"Link opens in a new window\") assertion library some of my teammates at Substantial are using on a React project. I had used the [Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en \"Link opens in a new window\") browser extension almost daily in the past few years and I knew there was an [open source audit library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools \"Link opens in a new window\"). (Addy Osmani's [a11y module](https://github.com/addyosmani/a11y \"Link opens in a new window\") was the closest starting point I could find.) My friend Karl Groves also just launched [Tenon.io](http://tenon.io \"Link opens in a new window\") with his partner Asa Baylus, providing the community with a Javascript-aware API with some of the most robust accessibility tests around. I knew there were licensing restrictions for Tenon, though, and it required you to send source code over the wire to their API, which wouldn't work for teams at Google. I could see value in providing both options so that developers could decide for themselves.\n\nI had no idea how to do these integrations at first, but like any good challenge, I faced it head on. I sought out to support both integrations right away. Here are some of the things I learned in creating an accessibility plugin for Protractor, a Node.js command-line application:\n\n## Working with promises\n\nYou will get very comfortable with return statements. Without them, nothing works (I know this is basic, but I was new to [promises](https://www.promisejs.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\")). If you need to return more than one thing–like two accessibility audits–you can push the values to be returned into an array and use `q.all` to return after everything has run.\n\n## Executing scripts in a WebDriver page context\n\nIf you don't have control over the script you're injecting, like an open source audit library, you won't be able to modify it to expose methods. This might make it difficult to interact with the script. To get around it with Protractor, we had to get a bit hacky and return a function call tacked onto the end of data returned from `fs.readFileSync`.\n\n```\nvar data = fs.readFileSync(AUDIT_FILE, 'utf-8');\n  data = data + ' return axs.Audit.run();';\n\n  return browser.executeScript_(data, 'a11y developer tool rules').then(function(results) {\n      // process results \n      ....\n\n```\n\nGetting hacky with readFileSync\n\n## Auditing with WebDriver element objects\n\nUsing the Accessibility Developer Tools, an audit script goes through the executing page and tests the elements on that page. When those elements are returned back to you as part of the results, they are WebDriver objects, not regular nodes. This was tricky to figure out–to get any identifying information about those elements, I had to do some more work. (See next section.)\n\n## Waiting for WebDriver element objects to be returned\n\nBecause the \"elements\" returned by the Devtools audit were WebDriver objects and not nodes, I had to iterate over them, fetch their outer HTML and return them as simple node strings using promises. I'm hoping to return a line number in the future or even a simple node tree in case you had two identical elements, but the current version will still help you find the offending nodes in your code.\n\n```\nDOMElements.forEach(function(elem) {\n  // get elements from WebDriver, add to promises array\n  elementPromises.push(\n    elem.getOuterHtml().then(function(text) {\n      return {\n        code: result.rule.code,\n        list: text.substring(0, elementStringLength)\n      };\n    })\n  );\n});\n```\n\nIterating over WebDriver objects to fetch their HTML\n\n## Associating them with their test failures\n\nEven after I'd fetched the WebDriver element's HTML as strings, because they were returned later in their own array using promises, I had to match them with their associated test failures. It was pretty easy once I added a test code to identify which failing test the element came from.\n\n## Passing Tenon page source without scripts running from CDNs\n\nTenon has two options for sending your code to them: `url` or `src`. Protractor is handling the page source during each test, so naturally we would send the source to Tenon as a string. This means for Tenon to do it's \"JavaScript-aware\" testing, scripts have to be loaded remotely from CDNs. If you're testing functionality related to routing, page rendering, or anything remotely Angular-like, you'll have to load scripts from CDNs.\n\n## Treating warnings as passes or failures\n\nIn this kind of testing, there is no concept of \"warnings\"–only pass or fail. In your configuration, you can decide whether warnings should pass or fail your build. We figured this would be useful if you wanted to use a more stringent set of tests if you were pushing code to production, or visa versa.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nThis was one of the most challenging things I've ever worked on, as well as the most rewarding. What helped me to get up to speed and deliver something quickly was the fact that people could actually use something I built to create a more accessible web. It also helped that Julie was presenting on it at [ng-conf](http://ng-conf.org \"Link opens in a new window\") in a few short weeks when I started on it. I ended up really enjoying working in Node.js, and I hope to take on more tasks like this in the future.","src/content/posts/angular-protractor-accessibility-plugin/index.mdx",[992],"./protractor-tenon-no-shadow.png","3a6cc5e5de2f0f1f","angularjs-material-design-ngaria",{"id":994,"data":996,"body":1001,"filePath":1002,"assetImports":1003,"digest":1005,"deferredRender":24},{"title":997,"date":998,"path":999,"coverImage":1000},"AngularJS Material Design & ngAria",["Date","2014-11-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"/angularjs-material-design-ngaria","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./angular-material1.png","[![Angular Material Design](./angular-material1.png)](https://material.angularjs.org \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nWhen [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html \"Link opens in a new window\") was launched, many of us in the accessibility community noticed that both the [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\") Material Design component demos hadn't been built with accessibility in mind. I remember saying out loud, \"companies can't continue to do this.\" Designers and developers must set an example with prototypes that work for everyone, especially at that scale.\n\nSomehow through the magic of Twitter, a.k.a. my big accessibility megaphone, Brad Green from the Angular team at Google invited me to speak at [ngEurope](http://ngeurope.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\") in Paris. He also expressed a need for some accessibility work to be done on the [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org \"Link opens in a new window\") project.

(It probably helped that I presented on Accessibility of MVC frameworks at [CascadiaJS](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/50o_Ig3lk08 \"Link opens in a new window\") and [JSConf EU](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/04DOp1F9Od4 \"Link opens in a new window\").)\n\nSince August, I've been fortunate enough to work remotely with members of the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\") team and the Angular.js core team, all from different parts of the country. I've participated in team meetings on Google Hangouts (sometimes a hot mess from biking up Capitol Hill), audited almost everything on the Angular Material website, opened and closed issues on [Github](https://github.com/angular/material/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), contributed pull requests to improve accessibility in components and in the docs themselves. I love suggesting accessibility ideas to the team because they're receptive, smart people: they run with the ideas and improve on them. As a designer/developer hybrid, interpreting a gorgeous design spec to create accessible framework components has been my happy place.\n\n![Thanks Google for the Nexus 5 test device!](./2014-09-26_1411763781.jpg)\n\nThanks Google for the Nexus 5 test device!\n\nAside from Material Design, I was asked to give feedback on a community-contributed module for accessibility, [ngAria](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAria \"Link opens in a new window\"). ngAria's goal is to improve Angular's default accessibility by hooking into directives and dynamically adding [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/ \"Link opens in a new window\") attributes for common scenarios. I had worked with Angular before, but not written a module for the core framework. It was a bit daunting, at first! After I had some time to review and comment, Brian Ford and Tobias Bosch made some useful architecture changes and ngAria was merged into Angular.js. It took using ngAria on the Material Design project for me to really evaluate it and find ways to make it better, which is currently an ongoing process. I rewrote the [Angular.js Developer Guide on accessibility](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/accessibility \"Link opens in a new window\") and also the [API docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAria \"Link opens in a new window\") for ngAria to explain the module better and to show examples. To accomplish this and much of my Material work with ngAria, I've spent time creating [Codepens](http://codepen.io/marcysutton/public/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and [Plunkers](http://plnkr.co/users/marcysutton \"Link opens in a new window\") to test assumptions about the module and see how it could evolve to be more useful. I've absolutely loved this mix of accessibility and UX research, development and communication.\n\nIt was [announced at ngEurope](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gNmWybAyBHI \"Link opens in a new window\") that Angular 2.0 will use Web Components and native DOM APIs instead of directives, controllers, and the jqLite DOM wrapper. This has great implications for accessibility, since we'll be able to extend native elements, which is better than bolting on a bajillion ARIA attributes (see [Bruce Lawson & Karl Groves' Web Components talk](http://www.paris-web.fr/2014/conferences/web-components-the-right-way.php \"Link opens in a new window\") discussing \"built-in vs. bolt-on\"). Angular evolving in this new direction to me seems necessary for it to stay relevant and useful. I was happy to hear they are going for Web Components, since I've already seen them in Ember.js and Polymer. Frameworks should do everything they can to help people code responsibly–in Angular, the ease with which you could create inaccessible markup has produced a bunch of inaccessible websites (there are [inaccessible examples](https://twitter.com/pauljadam/status/550822616898863106 \"Link opens in a new window\") in books, too). In the future, I'm hoping I'll get to work on Angular 2.0 since Web Components are of particular interest as an accessibility researcher and [presenter](/jsconf-2014-australia-accessibility-shadow-dom/ \"JSConf 2014\") on the subject.\n\nBy getting out there and talking about the need for accessibility, writing useful docs, and improving the utility of frameworks, I've seen accessibility become a mainstream topic. ngAria is listed next to ngAnimate, after all. It's cool to see a framework take on more responsibility and do some heavy lifting for marginalized users. I'll just keep bringing my energy and optimism even though I know realistically developers forget accessibility quite often. I can still try to _boil the ocean_ one talk or pull request at a time.\n\nIn November, I was a guest blogger on the official AngularJS blog about [Using ngAria](http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2014/11/using-ngaria.html \"Link opens in a new window\"), the accessibility module. It was a really great opportunity to talk about accessibility to a wide, mainstream audience and I'm grateful I had the chance.\n\nI am also speaking about Angular Accessibility at [Fluent Conf](http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/speaker/189759 \"Link opens in a new window\") and the [CSUN 30th Annual International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2015/sessions/index.php/public/website_pages/view/1 \"Link opens in a new window\"). I learned so much at CSUN last year (that's how we refer to the incredibly long conference name), I'm excited to give back on a topic that I started thinking about my first time there.

Here are some of my favorites from this year:\n\n- ### Solid Steel Radio Show 24/6/2016 Hour 1 - Moneyshot + Cheeba (Odelay Tribute Mix)\n    \n    I must have listened to this mix 20 times in a row.

As of Monday, June 25 2018, my job will be 100% Developer Advocate for Deque's accessibility services and products.\n\nWhy the change? If you follow me on Twitter, you [might have seen](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/1004581458663518208 \"Twitter opens in new window\") that I was a little stressed recently. To be honest, I was having a rough time balancing 50/50% product engineering and evangelism, and I burned out for the second time in my career.\n\nMy original role with Deque was intended to be a balanced mix of responsibilities, but in reality it felt like two full jobs that I wasn't excelling at. I started to feel unprepared for talks, which previously were both a joy and a breeze to get out there and execute (even though they were a ton of work). I constantly felt like I didn't have enough bandwidth to contribute to the product team, and it weighed on me as a huge source of stress. [Distributed team members](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/1003230665373028352 \"Tweet opens in new window\") across time zones, a very busy manager and remote work don't really help with that. Add wedding planning and a very scary political climate on top of it, and I nearly lost my mind.\n\nI took some time off to recover (yay [functioning adventure van](https://instagram.com/icebergthebeefy \"Instagram: opens in new window\")!), reflected on my career and thought long and hard about how I could excel at my job. I [yearned to do my best work again](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/999057529895206913 \"Twitter opens in new window\") without it being such a daily struggle. Job satisfaction is very important to me; when I'm doing good work, not only do I feel productive, but it helps my team. Feeling burned out and anxious helps no one. Luckily, I do have a lot to contribute and was able to make changes that have restored my mental health and happiness.\n\nStarting Monday, I'll be a member of Deque's Services organization instead of Product. My time will be spent on a mix of things that play to my strengths, including research on cutting-edge accessibility techniques, creation of demos and writing articles. I plan to host some workshops, both virtual and in-person, along with the annual [axe hackathon at CSUN](https://www.deque.com/blog/highlights-takeaways-2nd-annual-axe-hackathon/). Teams can [book my time for pairing](mailto:helpdesk@deque.com) and limited consulting, should you need some one-on-one technical accessibility help.\n\nOne cool thing is that by continuing to support the [axe](https://axe-core.org) ecosystem, I'll naturally facilitate communication between the Services and Product groups. It's sort of an experiment, as Developer Advocate is a brand-new role for Deque...but I feel like it's a natural fit for me, and I'm excited to apply my skills and interests to it. I see this role as a shift from product evangelism looking outward to representing customer and user needs from the outside-in.\n\nI still plan on doing some public speaking, but less than I have in the past four years (feel free to [get in touch](https://marcysutton.com/contact/) with me about your event, but recognize that I'm going to be quite selective). I've learned that 10 talks a year is far too many for me, and I'd rather spend some of that energy listening, doing research and building up my own skills so I can start making solid contributions again.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading. Now that my energy is coming back I'll be ready to contribute ideas and code again for the good of our industry. So look forward to seeing more from me out there on the interwebs to (hopefully) help make web accessibility easier.","src/content/posts/chapter-two-at-deque/index.mdx",[1028],"./woods1-web.jpg","3ca1acfb7fbf1d44","csun-accessibility-conference-recap",{"id":1030,"data":1032,"body":1036,"filePath":1037,"digest":1038,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1033,"date":1034,"path":1035},"CSUN 2014 Conference Recap",["Date","2014-04-10T00:00:00.000Z"],"/csun-accessibility-conference-recap","_This post was migrated from its original location on the [Substantial](http://substantial.com) blog._\n\n![Attendees of the 2010 CSUN Conference](./csun-conf-1.jpg \"Attendees of the 2010 CSUN Conference\")\n\nA few months ago I saw many of my accessibility heroes RSVPing for an event called the \"CSUN Tweetup.\" When I looked into the Tweetup, I found it was part of a larger event and I realized I'd been living in a cave for my entire career: The CSU Northridge’s Center on Disabilities had put on a conference for TWENTY-NINE YEARS and this was the first I'd heard of it. [The 29th Annual International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2014/sessions/ \"Link opens in a new window\") (to which I'll refer as _CSUN_) was happening very soon in San Diego, California. After talking with my coworkers and family, I decided I really wanted to be there since web accessibility has added so much purpose to my work. So I booked a flight and a \"Bed & Bike\" on AirBnB and made my way to the conference for four days of learning, networking and career growth.\n\n## The Workshops\n\nWhile there were other workshops going on, my first day at CSUN '14 was spent learning about [ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)](http://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/ \"Link opens in a new window\") from my heroes at WebAIM and the Paciello Group. ARIA was created to expand HTML's semantic vocabulary by providing developers with a way to add accessibility information where elements lack state or purpose. At CSUN, I got the chance to learn about ARIA from people who know it best. It was a fantastic learning opportunity that gave me the level of understanding I desired.\n\n[![Instagram photo from the CSUN morning ARIA Workshop: Guide Dogs being naughty](./guide-dogs.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/ls-bKTyXkd/ \"View on Instagram: Link opens in a new window\")\n\nGuide dogs will be dogs.\n\n### Technical things I learned at the CSUN ARIA Workshops\n\n- Always use native, accessible HTML first, then use ARIA to enhance or fill in gaps\n- When using ARIA roles, states and properties in our HTML code, there is a sweet spot we should try to find: not too much, not too little\n- ARIA does not change browser functionality; it only affects users of assistive technology\n- Be very careful with `role=\"application\"` if you use it, since it requires you to recreate every detail of native functionality you have taken away from the user ([More about the application role](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/aria-role-application-53608.html \"Link opens in a new window\"))\n- The Paciello Group’s [aViewer tool for Windows](http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/aviewer \"Link opens in a new window\") will show you the Accessibility Tree as a screen reader sees it\n\n_Interested in learning more about ARIA? Check out this post by Marco Zehe: [What is WAI-ARIA, what does it do for me, and what not?](http://www.marcozehe.de/2014/03/27/what-is-wai-aria-what-does-it-do-for-me-and-what-not/ \"Link opens in a new window\")_\n\nI felt validated within ten minutes of the first workshop on multiple usability issues I've encountered in my career. I met some very awesome people, who I respect and admire not just as accessibility advocates but as inspiring and hilarious individuals. I'm glad I wrote down my favorite moments from that first day, because they immediately take me back:\n\n### Favorite Moments\n\n- Hearing [Léonie Watson](http://tink.co.uk/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and [Lucy Greco](https://twitter.com/accessaces \"Link opens in a new window\") talk about the debate over screen reader detection\n- Sitting next to Léonie in the afternoon workshop and walking arm-in-arm to get tea and talk about Shadow DOM\n- [Karl Groves's](http://www.karlgroves.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\") mention of wedgies as a way to convince developers to change divs to buttons\n- [Steve Faulkner's](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/author/admin/ \"Link opens in a new window\") exhaustive exploration into the HTML5 details/summary elements\n- Meeting the architect of ARIA, [Aaron Leventhal](http://accessgarage.wordpress.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), at a party and being told I'm \"on the bleeding edge\" with my Shadow DOM research\n- Karl Groves saying he once saw a tabIndex value of 32,000 in a codebase (which is insane)\n\n[![Instagram photo by Marcy Sutton from the CSUN Exhibitors Hall](./man-v-robot.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/lvPkpeyXv5/ \"View on Instagram: Link opens in a new window\")\n\nBlind human to robot communication\n\n## The Conference\n\nI took [John Foliot's advice for newbies](http://john.foliot.ca/csun-for-newbies/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and planned out my entire conference schedule in advance. It took a few hours but was totally worth it since I could make quicker decisions about where to go and not feel like I missed out on anything (there were too many sessions to even count them all).\n\nRather than detail every session, I've written about the major breakthroughs I had at CSUN. The experience enabled me to see a bigger picture that practically brings a tear to my eye, it's so beautiful. The following are the most significant things I took away from this year's conference:\n\n### #AUX: Accessible User Experience\n\n_Influences: Billy Gregory, “Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Working in Digital Accessibility” & Whitney Quesenbery, “Accessibility as Innovation: Creating Accessible User Experiences”_\n\nI'd like to propose an acronym, hashtag or idea. It already exists, but I'd like to see it more widely adopted in our industry: AUX, or _Accessible_ User Experience, aims to bring accessibility awareness to earlier phases of digital design. Despite the mention of _persons_ in most User Experience definitions, UX commonly leaves out persons with disabilities from research and deliverables, such as personas. This has potential to negatively impact accessibility throughout a project and, arguably, the rest of the industry because \"everyone keeps forgetting.\"\n\nAlthough I'd love for the term we already have, _UX_, to regard people of all abilities, I feel the extra letter in _AUX_ may remind us of our friends with varied abilities. Accessibility as a core principle, from the top-down, is the most effective way to improve usability and accessibility on a project. It's a lot easier to make your work accessible from the very beginning than it is to clean it up later; the same could be said for mobile. Accessibility should accompany a multi-screen strategy from the very beginning. Less pain, more inclusive fun. AUX!\n\n[![Instagram photo from the Google CSUN Party at Balboa Park](./csun-google-party.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/lv4iTyyXtt/ \"View on Instagram: Link opens in a new window\")\n\nGoogle’s CSUN Party at The Prado, Balboa Park\n\n### Why I went to CSUN: To learn how browsers and screen readers work together\n\nPart of my desire to attend CSUN was to engage with browser & screen reader implementers on how the Shadow DOM works. I'd learned a lot by [doing my own research](http://substantial.com/blog/2014/02/05/accessibility-and-the-shadow-dom/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and reading [all](http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/ \"Link opens in a new window\") the [things](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/ \"Link opens in a new window\") but I thought I could gain a deeper understanding from people who make it all possible.\n\nOn Day 2, I attended _Accessibility and the Power of CSS: Disparities between Ideals and Reality_ by Takekshi Kurosawa from Mitsue-Links in Japan. Naturally, the title made me think it would be about CSS. It wasn't. Rather, it was about the subject for which I came: browsers and assistive technologies working together. Although Takeshi struggled through the presentation, I was excited to broaden my understanding on the subject. Some highlights:\n\n- CSS can override the semantics of HTML (such as `display: block` on a table)\n- DOM (Document Object Model) + Style Rules = “Rendering Tree”\n- The Rendering Tree represents the visual layout of a document: position, dimensions, colors, etc.\n- Browsers and assistive technology communicate through [Accessibility APIs](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/terms#def_accessibility_api \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- An [Accessibility Tree](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-implementation/#intro_treetypes \"Link opens in a new window\") is created from the rendered DOM and utilized by assistive technology\n- An Accessibility Object is a single node in the Accessibility Tree\n- Hidden HTML elements don’t have Accessibility Objects, so they are skipped by screen readers (using `display: none`)\n- The Accessibility Tree can be inspected with several tools: aViewer for Windows, DOM Inspector for Firefox\n\n#### Bonus: Shadow DOM Interview with Marco from Mozilla\n\nAfter some prompting by my acquaintance [Pratik Patel](https://twitter.com/ppatel \"Link opens in a new window\"), I also interviewed [Marco Zehe](http://www.marcozehe.de/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), Accessibility QA Engineer from Mozilla, about the Shadow DOM. It was a fun experience talking to Marco over a white chocolate mocha. His explanation of Firefox's transformation of HTML into something assistive technologies can use was very informative and it rounded out my understanding of the process. Particularly, I got a lot of value out of Marco's details about Web Components creating \"a container and subtree\" (like a video tag) and how screen readers transform that data structure into text that is then read aloud.\n\nAs a result of these experiences, I learned a _ton_ about the Document Object Model, a cornerstone concept for any web developer. This prompted me to read up on tree structures and I'm now more informed when speaking about Accessibility & the Shadow DOM. I'm continuing to work on my ability to explain document trees to non-technical folks, which is challenging but interesting.\n\n### Crowdsourcing the Accessibility Awareness Problem\n\nOne of the most impactful sessions I attended, _Crowdsourcing the Accessibility Awareness Problem_, was a panel led by [Sassy Outwater](https://twitter.com/SassyOutwater \"Link opens in a new window\"), [Sina Bahram](http://www.sinabahram.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and [Billy Gregory](https://twitter.com/thebillygregory \"Link opens in a new window\"). Some of the brightest minds in accessibility were in attendance. Sassy blindly (but accurately) threw chocolate bars to participants and I desperately hoped a guide dog wouldn't eat one. As part of this discussion, we talked about getting the accessibility message heard by a wider audience. Everyone there already knew the importance of it, so the question became: how do we not preach to the choir? It was an entertaining and enlightening discussion that transcended simply being a code monkey.\n\n[![Instagram photo from George Zamfir's CSUN talk on Responsive Web Design and Accessibility](./csun-who-is-disabled.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/lu7cYtSXi3/ \"View on Instagram: Link opens in a new window\")\n\nWho is more disabled: Revolutionary Physicist Stephen Hawking or Toronto Mayor Rob Ford?\n\n#### Why isn't accessibility known to everyone?\n\n- Lack of mass-media exposure\n- User fatigue: users give up on a service without providing feedback when something is inaccessible\n- Developers only like the shiny new thing\n- Developers develop for themselves\n- Businesses see it as costly and time consuming, with little ROI\n- Poor knowledge of audience\n\nWe talked about the problem and brainstormed solutions for getting the message out, such as: use a positive message, don't rely on fear. Make it marketable. Play with the titles and make talks you give at conferences available for people on the Web. Sina proposed creating a website for people to crowdshare accessibility topics, which I hope to see in the future.\n\n#### Accessible Robots™\n\nIn my quest to become a public speaker, I've been told “no” many times. I've been told that \"accessibility has been solved.\" People have essentially said they want more talks about _robots_ than _accessibility_ (noted). So I suggested to the panel that we instead talk about _accessible robots_. I’m still brainstorming possibilities for this idea, but it seemed to [hit](https://twitter.com/dalecruse/status/448890729210060801 \"Link opens in a new window\") [a nerve](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/448146165800771584 \"Link opens in a new window\"). My awesome new friend [Dale Cruse](https://twitter.com/dalecruse \"Link opens in a new window\") even talked about it on [The Web Ahead Podcast (00:56:40)](http://5by5.tv/webahead/64 \"Link opens in a new window\"). This warm welcome encouraged me to keep submitting proposals I care about: modern technology alongside accessibility. It's a departure from my previous feeling that \"maybe I shouldn't submit _another_ accessibility talk.\" In fact, I am now more empowered to focus on accessibility. To me, that is the holy grail of public speaking–to help an underserved community while learning new technology. It's exciting, shiny, and the right thing to do.\n\n### Increasing Accessibility Awareness Through Modern Code\n\n_Influences: Greg Kraus, \"Better Text Contrast Through Browser-Based Image Analysis\" and Ian Kelly, \"Accessibility with Angular JS\"_\n\nSome of my favorite sessions at CSUN discussed–surprise–accessible JavaScript. I absolutely loved Greg Kraus's talk about a [Color Contrast Analyzer extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-contrast-analyzer/dagdlcijhfbmgkjokkjicnnfimlebcll?hl=en-US \"Link opens in a new window\"); he created it using Web Workers in order to prevent the UI from locking up. Not only was it a cool topic, but I've also used the tool to show designer colleagues the impact of their color choices.\n\nIan Kelly's talk on _Accessibility with Angular JS_ got me thinking a lot about the accessibility of JavaScript MVC frameworks. I had the right amount of experience with Angular and knowledge of the Accessibility Tree to ask educated questions about the accessibility situation, and I left quite intrigued.\n\nUsing modern code topics such as these to get the accessibility conversation in front of a wider audience is a great approach to advocacy, as we concluded in the crowdsourcing panel. Accessible AngularJS has become my _Accessible Robots_ for the time being. I plan to do some research on my own and I've submitted it as a topic to CascadiaJS, a JavaScript conference here in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n## Conclusion: People are awesome.\n\nI met so many fantastic people at CSUN, all with varied abilities. They talked about their interests, how they use technology and told stories about their lives that made me proud to be an accessibility advocate. I left San Diego inspired, informed, networked, exhausted, and maybe a little hungover. :) I already have three talk ideas for next year, which will be the _30th year_. Hopefully we'll be on a _boat_! I say we, because I am now hooked on CSUN. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.\n\nAccessibility adds so much meaning to our work as designers, developers, testers, managers, students, and so on. It means that we understand and accept that our users are a diverse bunch. It means that when we meet people with or without disabilities, we can say _\"I care about you.\"_ I guess CSUN made me aware of how much I care about people and how that care has become intertwined in my work. Thank you, CSUN, for that humbling experience–I'll see you again next year with a lot more to learn and talk about.\n\n_Interested in learning more about the 2014 CSUN International Technology & Persons with Disabilities Conference?

In this post, I summarize the takeaways and legal advice from Harvard Cyberlaw's Web A11y Memorandum on defamation lawsuits._\n\nSince March 2015, the A11y Slack community has been a rich space for accessibility practitioners, designers, developers, managers, analysts, and more to share insights and learn from each other. The invite-only group has grown to over 14,000 members and includes people who build web browsers, screen readers, develop technical standards including WCAG, ARIA, and HTML, alongside people just getting into the industry.\n\nNaturally, members in a group of this size will have a wide range of interests and motivations. As an admin group, we monitor communications to ensure they align with our [Code of Conduct](https://accessibility.github.io/a11yslack/code-of-conduct.html) and foster a safe, friendly, and welcoming atmosphere. While A11y Slack is a private group where members can invite other members, so communications should be considered somewhat public.\n\nAs accessibility professionals, most of us in the group agree that constructive criticism on techniques and tools are an essential part of providing feedback and improving digital access.\n\nOne controversial aspect of digital accessibility has been the rise of Overlay technology, where vendors sell products that claim to improve accessibility with one line of code by using JavaScript to inject tools on top of the existing website with no other changes from the site owner. Many of us in the industry feel these products go the wrong direction when trying to improve access. When teams are left out of the accessibility process in favor of a \"bolted on solution\", they miss the opportunity to improve their craft. We would rather improve a website or application from the start so that access for people with disabilities is baked into the DNA of the experience. There are many benefits to creating inclusive designs that are beyond the scope of this post, but are truly important to us as a community.\n\n> You can learn more about overlays from the perspective of digital accessibility professionals on the Overlay Fact Sheet, signed by over 880 people in the industry as of September 2024 (disclaimer: I also signed the fact sheet, as signer number 172). https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/\n\n## Accessibility overlays and SLAPP suits\n\nUnfortunately, overlay companies have brought at least two lawsuits against members of the accessibility community for criticizing their products on Twitter (X) and elsewhere. These were definitely noticed:\n\n- AudioEye, Inc. v. Adrian Roselli, known as \"the SLAPP lawsuit heard around the world.\" May 2023 - Dropped in January 2024\n  - https://adrianroselli.com/2023/05/audioeye-is-suing-me.html\n  - https://www.lflegal.com/2023/07/adrian-roselli-slapp-lawsuit/\n- French accessibility advocates sued by FACIl’iti, a French overlay company in November 2023\n  - https://www.lflegal.com/2021/11/overlay-legal-update/#French-Overlay-Company-Sues-Advocates-for-Their-Role-in-the-Global-Overlay-Conversation\n\n_Note: a previous version of this article mistakenly wrote the French suit was towards a company, while it is actually towards individuals._\n\nThese lawsuits are considered SLAPP suits, intending to stifle criticism and debate by dissuading the accessibility community from producing negative publicity on overlay technology. They create a \"chilling effect,\" where people hesitate to exercise a right, such as freedom of speech, due to the fear of legal repercussions.\n\nFrom Google AI:\n\n> SLAPPs have several characteristics that contribute to their chilling effect, including:\n>\n> - **Frivolous lawsuits**: SLAPPs are often based on meritless, exaggerated, or frivolous claims.\n> - **Disproportionate solutions**: The solutions demanded by the plaintiff are usually disproportionate to the situation.\n> - **Power imbalance**: There is a disparity in power and resources between the plaintiff and the defendant.\n> - **Extended litigation**: SLAPPs are often lengthy and can exhaust the defendant's resources.\n> - **Obscured intent**: Plaintiffs often try to obfuscate their intent to censor or silence critics.\n>\n> SLAPPs can have a damaging effect on those who have not yet been targeted, as people may be reluctant to participate in public debate out of fear of being sued.\n\nThis article focuses on SLAPP suits in the United States, where each state has different laws. Obviously, suits can also be brought in other countries where the legal situation will vary widely. If you are in a jurisdiction with weak or no SLAPP laws, you might change your defense strategy.\n\n## Our community and SLAPP suits\n\nAs the largest accessibility Slack group with some of the same members who had been sued and people from companies doing the suing, we definitely worried about our safety and liability from SLAPP lawsuits. I [asked about it on Twitter (X)](https://x.com/marcysutton/status/1636801846433177600) but no one responded on this specific issue.\n\nI heard from members loud and clear that we needed to do something proactive to protect ourselves from these kinds of lawsuits. It was particularly obvious when a member from an overlay company promoted their efforts to gain legitimacy through the W3C and the community's response was highly skeptical and critical.\n\nDid we have anything to worry about with regards to our communications in the group being used in accessibility SLAPP lawsuits for alleged defamation?\n\n> **Defamation**: the action of damaging the good reputation of someone; slander or libel.\n\nFurther, the community wanted to know if members from overlay companies could be kicked out from the group. Would we want to do that, given overlay companies had been acquired by known and respected accessibility vendors? It seemed complicated.\n\n## Working with Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic\n\nTo figure out what to do next, I reached out to my network to see who we could engage to get legal advice.\n\nSlack's Terms of Service weren't super clear on the topic of lawsuits. As a volunteer community group and not an employer, we often deal with Slack not being designed for our purpose and we find moderation to be challenging in many ways. As a primary goal, I wanted advice on the specifics of our legal situation for digital communications on accessibility in Slack.\n\nOne of the leads I got last January was [Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic](https://hls.harvard.edu/clinics/in-house-clinics/cyberlaw-clinic/), a group within Harvard that \"provides high-quality, pro-bono legal services to appropriate clients on issues relating to the Internet, new technology, and intellectual property.\" They were just solidifying their docket for the semester so my timing was perfect. I thought our topic would be an interesting one from a legal analysis perspective and they agreed. They had done some disability work in the past, some discovery response, some anti-SLAPP work, and some law-enforcement request work. We got onto their docket and began meeting in February 2024.\n\nSomething I'll always remember about Harvard Cyberlaw's approach was something Kendra Albert, the director of the program said:\n\n> They are good and they are cheap, but they are not fast.\n\nWe wanted quality representation as a community group with no budget, so taking a bit of time was fine for us.\n\nAfter I gave them all the information I had, they did their work and provided us with a Web A11y Memorandum PDF (\"the memo\") in April 2024. We met virtually to go over it and I mulled over the options they gave as suggestions, noting their observed trade-offs.\n\n\u003Cfigure style=\"margin-bottom: 2em;\">\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;\">\n    \u003Cimg src=\"./memo-header.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Memorandum from Harvard Cyberlaw, to me from Keren Benzion & Emily Miller Cc: Kendra Albert on April 17, 2024\" />\u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">The Harvard Memo on A11y Slack Workspace Risk Mitigation (Full doc confidential)\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nOn the subject of defamation, the Memo had this to say (lightly edited for this blog post):\n\n> To meet the criteria for defamation, a plaintiff (the \"suer\") must show that the\ndefendant has made:\n>\n> 1) a false statement purporting to be fact;\n> 2) publication or communication of that statement to a third person;\n> 3) standard of fault amounting to at least negligence; and\n> 4) damages, or some harm caused to the reputation of the person or entity\nwho is the subject of the statement.\n>\n> Publication to one party satisfies the second prong, and\n> that the Slack group is private would not negate publication.\n> Damages can include a demonstrated pecuniary loss, like a loss of business.\n> Therefore, this analysis will focus on prongs one and three.\n\nThe standard of fault outlined in the Memo described how liability can vary depending on the subject of the defamatory statement, as well as by state (note this advice is geared toward people in the United States). States with anti-SLAPP lawsuits give plaintiffs some legal protections in lawsuits that lack merit and are intended to silence critics.\n\nIn Adrian Roselli's lawsuit, his attorney filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to New York's anti-SLAPP law, but the case settled before the court rendered a decision on that issue.\n\n## My takeaways from The Memo\n\nAfter going through the process with Harvard Cyberlaw and digesting their analysis, my takeaways included:\n\n- **Ultimately, we can't completely prevent a defamation lawsuit.** We can help to educate our members about statements of facts versus opinions and advise them about legal liability and some of the other takeaways in the memo. I felt the most delicate way of handling this and not further chilling speech was to make some recommendations in the Code of Conduct (under \"Content Suggestions\"). Then, if someone is worried or curious about this they can seek out the information.\n- As admins/moderators, we are covered under [Section 230](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) and likely not liable for defamation claims made by members in the group or elsewhere. As posters (\"speaking personally here...\"), we don't have this same legal protection.\n- Banning members from overlay companies was described as a \"nuclear option\", and not something we wanted to do. So we didn't do it, but we continue to monitor communications to ensure they adhere to our guidelines.\n- We could consider changing the content retention/deletion settings for specific channels to limit legal exposure for members. This approach could give a bit of a safer space where people can vent but not worry about Discovery turning up those conversations in a lawsuit.\n  - Note: We haven't done this as the big trade-off is that helpful content would no longer be searchable to members for safe and legitimate purposes.\n- If someone does find themself at the center of a defamation lawsuit, the recommendation was to contact the EFF or the other suggested law firms/resources at the end.\n\nWe outlined a Solicitation policy in our Code of Conduct as a result of this work and at the request of our community, as people were tired of feeling like they were being heavily advertised to in a professional networking space. The intent was to draw more clear lines between company advertising and community discussions by streamlining them into a specific channel. We also suggest that members document their company and role in their Slack profile so their motivations are clear. The Solicitation policy is something we've developed further with community feedback, so we can strike the right balance for safety and professional development.\n\n## Going forward as a community\n\nWe may make additional recommendations or changes based on these findings as time goes on. As a digital accessibility community leadership group, we volunteer on things as time and energy permits. Like Harvard Cyberlaw, we tend to move a bit slower – this helps us try and get things right for community moderation in a sustainable way. We've recently expanded our admin / moderation team from a group of 3, which was extremely necessary for a Slack group of our size (14,184 as of this writing). So I'm sure that further discussion will continue as our leadership team grows and this article is shared.\n\nMy best advice to anyone concerned about SLAPP lawsuits and accessibility is to choose your words carefully when providing criticism in public(ish) spaces. It's unfortunate that we have to do that – it is somewhat of a chilling effect of these lawsuits in action. But there is still a way to provide constructive criticism by ensuring your factual statements are provably true and/or literally presenting them as personal opinions (\"It is my opinion that…\"). If you are concerned about your legal liability from overlay companies when discussing products online, this advice might apply to you.\n\nAs technology professionals who spend a lot of time online, we should keep in mind that there are real people on the other end of our communications. This includes people we consider to be taking the wrong steps for accessibility and technology. Would you say something the same way if they were in front of you, in person? Perhaps you would. Or, maybe you would frame your feedback differently with this idea in mind. As we always say in accessibility, it depends.","src/content/posts/developing-anti-slapp-policies-a11y-slack-harvard-cyberlaw/index.mdx",[1050],"./hero-lawsuit-crowd.jpg","e5b41667257aa1a5","encouraging-contributions-with-docs",{"id":1052,"data":1054,"body":1059,"filePath":1060,"assetImports":1061,"digest":1063,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1055,"date":1056,"path":1057,"coverImage":1058},"Encouraging Open Source Contributions with Docs: a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy",["Date","2020-04-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"/encouraging-contributions-with-docs","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./gatsby-repo-feb2020.png","![Gatsby GitHub repository](./gatsby-repo-feb2020.png)\n\nOpen source is all about making software available to everyone to use. But there's a bit of a paradox: create something that developers really need and want, and they'll use it so much that the burden to support and maintain it becomes overwhelming. To overcome this and make a popular open source project more sustainable, it's essential to write discoverable documentation for people to contribute so they can help shoulder some of the effort. [Funding](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-02-11-founding-organizations/) is also a factor in open source sustainability, but that's beyond the scope of this post.\n\n**Lacking documentation in open source is a self-fulfilling prophecy** that prevents users from contributing and inhibits project growth. By investing in docs and processes for contributors, they'll feel more welcome and able to participate in developing the project. You'll also have a higher likelihood of increasing project popularity, as developers legitimately become more invested in following it.\n\nWithout an [inclusive system for contributions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-02-17-changing-the-oss-status-quo/), you'll limit who participates in an open source project to those with insider access or the time and resources to figure it out. This can affect the project itself, as open source contributors are almost always users as well. If they can't build the project or run tests to make improvements to it, they'll need to rely on maintainers to implement their use case. With misaligned priorities and a lack of action in a project, users may move on to something else that actively supports their needs.\n\nSoftware decisions are about trade-offs, yet different developers, teams, or companies might have their own priorities that impact how (or when) decisions are made. When open source consumers submit an issue for a feature request or improvement that isn't part of a roadmap, it gets placed far down the list of things for core maintainers to work on (\"parking lot\" issues, if you will). This is where contributions can make a difference: if those with wish-list issues are enabled to independently submit pull requests (PRs) that meet project standards, it can expand that project's ability to grow even with limited bandwidth.\n\n## Contributing in Gatsby.js\n\nFor the past year, I worked as the Head of Learning for the open source website framework [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), in charge of its documentation and learning experience. I'm now a Lead Engineer on the Developer Relations and Community team, so my role in creating docs is different but my expertise and passion for developer education and community remains.\n\nWhen I joined as Head of Learning, I inherited a solid foundation of [documentation](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [contributor processes](https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/). I've seen how Gatsby's investment into docs as a company has translated into big numbers: nearly 3200 contributors to the documentation and source code, and over 43k GitHub stars at the time of writing. During Hacktoberfest in October 2019, we merged over 630 PRs!\n\nHaving an independent docs site with extensive user and contributor documentation, including a [Code of Conduct](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-of-conduct/) and [Style Guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-style-guide/), as well as an [active GitHub repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and [docs translation process](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/translation) supports growth of those numbers. It also helps that Gatsby is a mainstream project as opposed to more niche tooling; not a judgement of smaller projects, but a quantifiable reality I've observed coming from the accessibility community.\n\nI'll never tire of reading tweets from developers celebrating their [first open source contribution](https://twitter.com/kimberrypi/status/1162444570501607424) in Gatsby. I can see the project growing stronger and supporting more people's use cases every day by enabling and encouraging them to contribute, and that's super cool.\n\n## Tracking and metrics in open source docs\n\nTracking and quantifying growth is often a component of managing an OSS project. In my time leading Gatsby Learning, we were more concerned with the amount of content coverage and accuracy for common user workflows than growing the number of contributors. But having a healthy contributor base helps us provide better docs, as a large content surface area and a small internal team means we need all the help we can get to support more use cases.\n\nThis also enters into the realm of Developer Relations, where metrics are chosen to measure specific growth areas. With separate teams and ownership of different objectives like we have at Gatsby, we need to be highly collaborative to experiment and produce meaningful outcomes that support the project's overall goals and priorities. DevRel at Gatsby will collaborate closely with the Product Marketing team that now produces documentation, for example, to ensure they have the latest information from our open source community.\n\n### Keeping the work going\n\nIt's worth saying that you also need a culture open to experimentation that encourages trying new things in the first place: that's a cornerstone of Developer Relations. If your advocates have their ideas shut down repeatedly, especially when they're surfacing feedback from users and contributors to grow the project, frankly, they'll burn out and stop trying after a while.\n\nTo keep your project from appearing stale and losing steam, issues and PR contributions need to be addressed and not left hanging. Support this effort by tracking metrics that matter: the number of external contributors (including repeat contributions!), number of open issues and PRs, age of those open issues and PRs, and more.\n\nWhat exactly you should measure will depend on what you want to achieve with your project. Maybe you don't _really_ care about open source growth because it's a marketing/influencer tool for your paid software, and you aren't going to prioritize the open source community's needs at your paid software's expense so you can keep operating. It's still worth considering how you'll grow and sustain your open source project to keep it from growing stale, before a competitor slides in and better supports users and contributors, eventually taking your place.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that users don't care about metrics. They care about whether they can do something using your open source software, so a process to resolve issues and PRs for your community at regular intervals is essential. Metrics are a means to doing that more effectively and making a business case for open source growth, reach, and value.\n\n### Living your values and priorities\n\nA previous role of mine at a different company for an open source accessibility testing tool involved tracking metrics for its GitHub repo. This experience gave me a lot to think about as I moved on to a larger, more mainstream project.\n\nOne of my \"rocks\" in that role included growing the repo's GitHub stars, and at the time it seemed to naturally grow with the number of high-profile accessibility conference talks and blog posts I delivered. Looking back, I believe stars were a vanity metric that I'm now unclear what value they truly added (I didn't put them on the list but I didn't propose anything else, either). There's much more I could have done to grow a strong contributor base to grow the project's reach and make it more active with contributions from non-core team members (such as better docs!). But the project also had to be balanced with work on paid software, and that tension with priorities contributed to the outcome of contributor experience being a lower priority.\n\nMaintaining a healthy open source community is a continous exercise in putting your values and priorities to work. An enforceable Code of Conduct provides a safer environment for a diverse community and makes it clear that poor behavior and harassment are not to be tolerated. On the other hand: cryptic, lacking, and outdated documentation sends the message that contributions should be limited to an insider circle of people who are smart enough to figure it out, and that open source contributions aren't that important. If your docs and contribution processes don't reflect the values and growth trajectory you want for your open source project, it's time for a rethink.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo how do you encourage contributions in open source? Write documentation, including contributing docs with instructions for how to set up the project and run tests. Add comments and tests to the code, and keep them up to date as the project evolves by requiring docs changes with every relevant PR. Make docs easy to discover and use: this means publishing them somewhere other than in GitHub source code, like a docs site or even a Wiki. These things can help you avoid the self-fulfilling prophecy of lacking docs translating into few contributors.\n\nMaking it possible for non-developers can also really help a project grow. Include content that doesn't rely on reading source code to know how to contribute, and allow people to contribute small PRs to improve documentation. Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity to encourage people to contribute to open source for the first time, and labeling issues with \"good first issue\" or \"help wanted\" can provide pathways for them to take their first step. Treat contributors of all skill levels with respect and dignity, as you never know someone's life experience.\n\nIdentify pain points with your project as it grows, such as issues and PRs from contributors going stale, and figure out how you're going to improve on it. Add metrics to track progress in those areas and hold them accountable for related goals, so teams have an incentive to change. It's worth it to keep your open source project growing sustainably, if you want people to actually use it; otherwise, what's the point of making it open source in the first place?","src/content/posts/encouraging-contributions-with-docs/index.mdx",[1062],"./gatsby-repo-feb2020.png","9693fbf51db28261","evinced-automated-accessibility-testing",{"id":1064,"data":1066,"body":1072,"filePath":1073,"assetImports":1074,"digest":1076,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1067,"date":1068,"path":1069,"coverImage":1070,"excerpt":1071},"Evinced is Pushing the Limits of Automated Accessibility Testing",["Date","2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"/evinced-automated-accessibility-testing","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./evinced-site-scanner-bahnde.png","Evinced has launched a suite of new testing tools that are pushing the limits of what's possible to test accessibility automatically.

I want the process of developing accessible websites to be as successful and encouraging as possible so we can make the internet a more inclusive place. There are great tools on the market for accessibility testing of websites and web applications. I've worked on multiple in my career including some of the leading ones: [axe-core](https://deque.com/axe), [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io), [Tenon](https://tenon.io), and [Protractor for Angular](/angular-protractor-accessibility-plugin).\n\nI believe that semi-automated tooling such as browser extensions and fully automated accessibility tests with Cypress, Jest, Selenium, or similar (which I'll group together as \"automated checks\") are essential to building and sustaining accessible websites. Tooling can help highlight issues in the development process without relying on manual review for absolutely everything. Much progress has been made in this area since I started as a developer in 2009.\n\nHowever, automated tooling for accessibility can only go so far. In my role as a developer advocate for axe-core, I often stated its JavaScript engine could find only 30-50% of accessibility issues on a page by volume. In fact, it's possible to create a website that passes automated checks while continuing to pose barriers to access for people with disabilities. Developers may not go any deeper than an automated tool result to assess or improve the situation. If you haven't already seen Manuel Matuzovic's post on [building the world's most inaccessible site possible with a perfect Lighthouse score](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/) (Lighthouse uses axe-core), I'd highly recommend a read.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n    ![Evinced's User Flow Analyzer extension running on Meetup.com, with many errors](evinced-user-flow-analyzer.png)\n\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Evinced's User Flow Analyzer extension run on Meetup.com\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## Enter, Evinced\n\nThat brings me to the core subject of this post: a startup called [Evinced](https://www.evinced.com/) has [launched](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evinced-raises-17m-announces-series-a-to-launch-enterprise-digital-accessibility-platform-for-software-development-teams-301220961.html) a suite of new testing tools that I feel are pushing the limits of what's possible to test accessibility automatically by completely rethinking the approach. They've created an entirely new testing engine and growing set of validations (rules) that evaluate webpages using computer vision and Artificial Intelligence to create a semantic structural model of a page partially based on its visual design, rather than relying on JavaScript to evaluate code syntax and functionality rendered in the browser. Evinced's [series of tools](https://www.evinced.com/products/) utilize this new engine, including a Site Scanner (with a free community edition), Dev Debugger extension, User Flow Analyzer extension, SDKs for automated software testing, and a free iOS Debugger application.\n\nEvinced approached me about their project last fall and I tested out some of the tools to see what they could do. I thought they were quite ambitious to tackle problems in an already-crowded space but their revolutionary approach to analyzing webpages filled a gap for me immediately: a way to detect keyboard-inaccessible elements in a browser extension. I knew from experience, there was no clear way to write that rule effectively and cross-platform using JavaScript alone. I also liked their budding site scanner and its component grouping functionality and thought it would solve a need for many teams and independents. \n\nA reevaluation of how to scan a webpage using computer vision seemed very promising to me in raising the number of possible scanned violations. Some investors had already agreed: Evinced raised a seed round and Series A funding to spend dedicated time and effort pushing through this ceiling.\n\n## I know what you’re going to say...\n\nFinance hasn't historically had the most positive reputation in the accessibility community, with multiple vendors acquired by larger firms (Paciello Group and Level Access) and VC-funded organizations [fighting with each other over patents](https://www.lflegal.com/2020/09/audioeye-vs-accessibe/). AccessiBe in particular has been selling overlay add-on products to site owners that [don't actually solve accessibility problems but attempt to auto-fix them](https://www.lflegal.com/2020/08/quick-fix/) at runtime. Overlays contribute to a culture where site and theme developers aren't notified or required to fix their own code, and the systemic inaccessible cycle continues.\n\nWhile Evinced is supported by venture capital, they are focused on solving the core problems of inaccessible development with tools that teach developers and other team members how to build more accessible sites and apps. They are eager for feedback from the community and are committed to making their products the most useful and accessible they can be. [As a consultant](/outsider-leverage-accessibility/), I've been transparent with them about what needs to improve in addition to what is working well. Their approach is definitely ambitious, and there are some rough edges in their solutions at the moment. But that also seems expected for a 2-year old company working on multiple solutions at the same time, and I'm encouraged by their work ethic.\n\nI'll be interested to see how Evinced uses their computer vision and AI algorithms to create revolutionary accessibility rules, since they've really opened up what's possible by doing things in a new way. As the Evinced team evolves their prototypes into production-ready validations, there will be more solutions for things that would otherwise require manual or custom automated testing, like tricky color contrast problems and missing keyboard support.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"border\">\n\n    ![Evinced's Site Scanner](evinced-site-scanner-bahnde.png)\n    \n    \u003Cfigcaption>Evinced's Site Scanner web application run on Bahn.de\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI also now have better answers to a couple of questions I've seen floating around the community for the past few years, including:\n\n- **What should I use to crawl or scan a list of webpages for accessibility?** Try the Evinced Site Scanner, with a community free service. There's an enterprise free trial as well where you don't need to speak to a sales person.\n- **How can I test a native mobile app for accessibility?** Try the free iOS Debugger, with other native platforms coming soon.\n\nThe need for manual accessibility testing will never fully go away. There is simply too much nuance for computers to make websites and apps intuitive and accessible without human review. Pushing the limits of what's possible can bring us closer to an accessible web by making development easier. This launch feels like a step in the right direction.","src/content/posts/evinced-automated-accessibility-testing/index.mdx",[1075],"./evinced-site-scanner-bahnde.png","6f8a16c4c140dcd6","focus-on-what-matters",{"id":1077,"data":1079,"body":1085,"filePath":1086,"assetImports":1087,"digest":1089,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1080,"date":1081,"path":1082,"coverImage":1083,"excerpt":1084},"Focus on What Matters",["Date","2022-09-29T00:00:00.000Z"],"/focus-on-what-matters","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./baby-hiking.jpg","I've landed on a new mantra through times of great change: focus on what matters. What's the most important thing right now?","2022 has been a time of major life change for me. In addition to working successfully for the second year as an independent, I got married in January and celebrated two major launches by the end of July: my [Testing Accessibility project](/testing-accessibility) and a new baby, respectively.\n\nThis all comes after a turbulent few years in my professional and personal life, with plenty of growth lessons (and lots of therapy). And yet, I’ve moved gracefully through these milestones. I landed on a mantra that kept me centered through it all: **_focus on what matters_**.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    ![Me, my husband, and our baby on a hiking trail](./family-hiking.jpg)\n\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Our little family hiking in the North Cascades\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI wish I’d come up with this mantra years ago. It could have saved me a lot of heartache as I chased career ambitions and found myself far off track. I eventually crashed and burned. When I felt the drive to work endlessly, said yes to another trip taking me far away from home (pre-pandemic), and continued to push myself to impress the tech industry at the expense of my health, it would have helped to do regular gut checks and ask, “what’s the most important thing right now?”\n\nPerhaps I might have noticed sooner that things were out of balance. That I was running away from home to bury my feelings. My career was going amazingly well from the outside but tearing me apart on the inside.\n\nMy priorities have definitely shifted in the past few years as I’ve grown older. I no longer care about being _seen_ and _heard_ as I once did. I am no longer looking for attention and validation as a content creator and I’m even less excited about doing constant work even if it’s stable and meaningful (I’m too hooked on independence!). I want more time to reflect, breathe, and create. I want to surround myself with nurturing relationships that encourage me to be my best self. It is a noticeable shift to let go of feeling competitive and to focus instead on what matters in my heart: balancing making a positive impact with living a healthy, happy life.\n\nI had the same goal of _work-life balance_ as an accessibility-focused web developer in years past (as noted with my personal interest in bikes, adventure vans and making pies), but the way I lived had a big cost. I never truly refilled my tank when my eye was always on the next talk, the next tweet, or the next pull request. I wasn’t present in the day-to-day moments in my life. Unsurprisingly, trying to please everyone else without focusing on my core needs led me to be a very unhappy person.\n\nThis year felt different, though. I worked just enough to get everything done that I needed to and I otherwise took the pressure off to “do more”. I still worked extremely hard ahead of the birth of our baby so I could coast when she was born, including the [Testing Accessibility launch](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/1547299758519099393) and a number of client contracts. I ended up getting so much more done in this time period than I had in years of feeling burned out, that I beat my highest annual full-time salary as a freelancer by September. Oh, and did I mention I was _extremely_ pregnant?\n\nI still get anxious and distracted like I used to but now I give myself some grace. I take a break and come back to it. I keep chipping away at my to-do list and prioritize what is the most time sensitive or important thing. It feels good to cross things off my list and achieve major milestones that I’ve accomplished by staying focused yet giving myself lots of rest.\n\nI say all of this for two reasons:\n\n1. To give you a little update for how things have gone this year, since I haven’t prioritized writing on this site (one of the things I let drop, on purpose).\n2. To encourage you to do regular gut checks in your life to see if any course corrections are needed. Are you working on the right thing right now? Spending time with the right people? Getting enough rest?\n\nI’ll keep repeating this mantra: what’s the most important thing right now? What’s the next most important thing?\n\n_Focusing on what matters_ has been the most magical, transformative approach to develop in my life in years. I don’t have regrets for how things have gone since it took all of those experiences to get me to this place in life. But I know now that I have a lot of power to keep my life on track in the pursuit of happiness. I also appreciate the privileges involved with being able to nudge my life in the right direction, since there isn’t much interference.\n\nGratitude is at the core of my practice, both for the important things kept in the queue and the unimportant things I cut loose. It’s like Marie Kondo’s practice of thanking the material possessions she gives away. When you focus on what matters, you spark joy from positive movements and also benefit from the release of tension when letting go.\n\nThank you, life, for all you have to offer.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    ![The top of a baby's head covered in a little gray hat, in the mountains](./baby-hiking.jpg)\n\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Family dreams coming true...my baby on trail.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>","src/content/posts/focus-on-what-matters/index.mdx",[1088],"./baby-hiking.jpg","344026e3261fd15a","how-i-audit-a-website-for-accessibility",{"id":1090,"data":1092,"body":1097,"filePath":1098,"assetImports":1099,"digest":1101,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1093,"date":1094,"path":1095,"coverImage":1096},"How I Audit a Website for Accessibility",["Date","2014-07-22T00:00:00.000Z"],"/how-i-audit-a-website-for-accessibility","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./how_i_audit_headings.png","_This post was migrated from its original location on the [Substantial](http://substantial.com) blog and updated on March 17, 2020._\n\n## Contents\n\n- Headings and Semantic Structure\n- Keyboard Interactivity\n- Automated Testing\n- Screen Readers\n- Color Contrast\n- Tools\n\nWhen I started working on [Distiller](http://drinkdistiller.com) in 2014, my initial feelings were that it had great visual design, super cool branding, and intriguing subject matter–whiskey–and it presented an opportunity to learn the server-side while innovating on the front-end. One of my personal goals for the project was to expose the product's \"cool factor\" to people who couldn't see it or use a mouse. Everyone wants a good user experience no matter their abilities. I was also pretty sure blind or visually impaired people would appreciate an app to help them find whiskey as much as anyone. Here are some of the key areas I've been addressing as I've adopted that challenge.\n\n## Headings and Semantic Structure\n\nSomething I wish more developers and designers knew: the purpose of an HTML heading is to indicate structure, not to indicate style (that's what CSS is for!). There are also HTML landmarks which create a programmatically meaningful structure, using [HTML5 landmark elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/HTML5.html) or bolted-on with [ARIA roles](https://a11yproject.com/posts/getting-started-aria/).\n\nHeadings and landmarks act as a table of contents for your page, similar to hierarchal outlines you may have created in Microsoft Word using roman numerals and numbers. Screen readers can surface headings and other element collections as an overall page outline and a device for navigating web content (see [Voiceover's Rotor](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/cell-phones-tablets-mobile/apple-ios-iphone-and-ipad-2) or [NVDA's Element List](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html#ExcelElementsList). In addition, as search engines' page rank algorithms have evolved, meaningful content hierarchies with headings have continued to improve search engine optimization (SEO).\n\n![Distiller's Original Heading Outline and Styleguide](./how_i_audit_headings.png)\n\n_Headings on the Distiller Homepage and in the Live Style Guide_\n\nTo begin an accessibility audit in 2020, I'd evaluate the headings on a site using the Headings feature under Ad-Hoc Tools in [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/), a really great browser testing extension. In 2014, I was still using Information > View Document Outline with the [Firefox Web Developer Toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/).\n\nThe test indicated we had quite a bit of room for improvement in our markup. Headings site-wide had been chosen for style purposes, without attention paid to semantics, and therefore there were no useful page outlines. I wanted to fix them all immediately. However, fixing headings would have to be an ongoing process–I had to resist the urge to refactor code beyond the scope of my current feature. Instead, I added global CSS classes that matched our live style guide and only refactored code that fit in with the current story. As we touched different parts of the app through feature stories, I would get the opportunity to improve the accessibility of the code-base. Also, I shared knowledge with my team on the purpose of headings and how best to use them so they could create more useful page structures moving forward.\n\n## Keyboard Accessibility\n\nMy approach to testing keyboard navigation is simple: I tab through a webpage with the keyboard. Quite often, a lack of visual feedback shows me that keyboard accessibility was not a priority. Developers tend to develop only for themselves; with the ability to bail on keyboard navigation when they get lost by falling back to the mouse or trackpad, most of the time it is forgotten. On Distiller, there wasn't much visual feedback even for mouse interactions. I created a story for hover and focus styles to be implemented first in the brand style guide and then throughout the rest of the app.\n\nWhen you include focus styles in your CSS, keyboard accessibility can improve a lot. They're easy to add if hover states are already in place on “focusable” elements. If hover styles are applied to elements that can't receive focus by default, such as list items, they must be moved to elements that can receive focus, like buttons or form inputs. Anything else requires adding a `tabindex` attribute in HTML and binding interaction events in JavaScript. Anchors, buttons, and inputs get support from `tabindex` and interaction events by default, so it's generally not worth the trouble to use other elements for anything that should be interactive.\n\nFocus management is also a big part of keyboard accessibility and something we continued to work on for Distiller. What is focus management? An example: when a modal window opens, focus should move from the element that triggered it to an element inside of the modal, preferably a close button. This enables a keyboard or screen reader user to easily tab and find their way to new content on the screen. When the modal window is closed, focus should be sent back to the triggering element.\n\nOn Distiller, I noticed a new feature badly needing keyboard interactivity and focus management: the Top Shelf allowed users to select up to 5 whiskey bottles for their personal profile. With this, we added the ability to rearrange the bottles with drag & drop. Making it accessible from the keyboard was challenging because every time you moved a bottle, the HTML for the entire list was ripped out and re-rendered, thereby sending focus back to the top of the page (this is called “freak-out mode”). To improve the experience, when the list was replaced in the DOM we used JavaScript to send focus back to it afterward. This allowed us to continue using the existing templating solution while improving the accessibility of Distiller's Top Shelf feature.\n\n## Automated Testing\n\nIn addition to checking the heading outline and tabbing through a webpage, I usually start with a few automated tools. As of 2020 [Google Chrome's Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and [Microsoft's Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io) are great tools to audit your code to point out common issues, and they can both look inside Shadow DOM subtrees (for more on this topic from 2014-2015, read my post on [Accessibility and the Shadow DOM](/accessibility-and-the-shadow-dom/))!\n\nSome items that came up in an audit of Distiller using the [Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en), a precursor to Lighthouse:\n\n- A loading graphic without an alt attribute (courtesy of Zendesk's feedback tab)\n- Color contrast warnings\n- Warning about meaningful images not to be used as element backgrounds\n- Warnings about focusable links being invisible or obscured by other elements\n\nThese warnings allow you to inspect the DOM to find out more information about the issues. In our case, we had links only containing icons and not any descriptive text; divs with background images for a responsive content strategy; and plenty of anchors used as buttons. As with the headings and keyboard navigation, I updated code only within the context of user stories and planned to address the rest in the coming weeks.\n\n2020 update: it's important to balance your testing efforts amongst manual and automated processes as [Manuel Matuzovic's blog post](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/) and [Eric Bailey's Smashing Magazine post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/09/importance-manual-accessibility-testing/) explain. Automated tools can't catch everything, but you can write  unit and integration/end-to-end tests to bake accessibility functionality into your app or website. To learn more about automated testing with modern tools, check out my [course on Frontend Masters](/frontend-masters-javascript-accessibility/) and a [blog post I wrote on automated accessibility testing](https://www.24a11y.com/2017/writing-automated-tests-accessibility/).\n\n## Screen Readers\n\nIn single-page apps, views are appended, updated or removed without page reloads. Imagine tabbing with the keyboard onto a nav item and expecting new content but instead not going anywhere, or worse, experiencing “freak-out mode” where focus is lost. What changed? What were you trying to do, again? Without sending users' focus to new content after it is appended, web applications using React, Ember, Vue, Angular, Backbone, or other front-end JavaScript frameworks will not be accessible to keyboard or screen reader users. Unfortunately, it's happening a lot now that JavaScript MV\\* frameworks are on the rise, and Distiller was no exception.\n\nTo experience the site from a non-sighted user's point of view, I fired up VoiceOver for Mac, closed my eyes and tried navigating through it in Chrome and Firefox. I also tested with JAWS and Internet Explorer on a Windows virtual machine using VirtualBox for Mac (_2020 update: I use Parallels now instead_). Any time we made a change for accessibility, I could test whether the experience improved using my small test suite.\n\nSome other items I tested and addressed for screen reader accessibility:\n\n- Elements with only non-semantic, visual icons or images\n- A global “flash notice” telling users when they had successfully logged in or out\n- Non-visual current page indicators\n- Audible notification of page changes (JAWS announces them, VoiceOver still needs help)\n\n### 2020 Update\n\nThere are some great resources for learning about screen reader testing from [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/), and a wonderful [Smashing Magazine webinar on how screen reader users access the web](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/accessibility-webinar/) from Léonie Watson in 2019. But it's worth mentioning that getting started with screen readers can have a steep learning curve, and without a disability yourself, your experience will differ from users with disabilities.\n\nIn addition to working with people with disabilities on product teams, conducting paid user testing with groups like [Fable Tech Labs](https://makeitfable.com) or [Access Works](https://access-works.com/) can be great for learning how screen reader users access _your product_ or website. It's a process that will change your design and development team's perspective forever. Read more about my experience of working with Fable on a research project for my current employer, Gatsby: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/\n\n## Color Contrast\n\nTo test color contrast, I've started using the Color Contrast Analyzer for Chrome. This tool takes a screenshot of a webpage and evaluates the pixels surrounding any text to determine if it meets [WCAG color contrast ratio requirements](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast). Small non-bold text has a different ratio than medium bold and large non-bold text, so you can test both at levels AA and AAA. For Distiller, I found a few places where color contrast could be bumped up but overall, the brand colors stood out pretty well and major changes were not necessary.\n\nAnother great tool for testing foreground and background color combinations for accessibility is [Lea Verou's Contrast Ratio](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/). Simply enter two color values and see the ratio in red (failing) or green (passing) along with some text information to keep things accessible.\n\nIn 2020, there are many testing tools but the ones I keep coming back to include the [Paciello Group's Color Contrast Analyzer](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/), a desktop app which can sample any application on your computer. I also like [Chrome's DevTools color contrast picker](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference#contrast) and have seen [Figma extensions for designers](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-for-everyone-with-these-accessibility-focused-plugins/) that could be useful.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClient-side web applications like Distiller are growing in numbers. We love snappy, responsive user interfaces and JavaScript libraries that encourage separation of concerns. But without attention paid to keyboards and assistive technologies, our apps won't be usable by people with disabilities. Ideally, we would build with accessibility in mind from the beginning…that's definitely the best approach (and the most fun). But if you do find yourself working on a code-base with room for accessibility improvement, having a collection of best practices and testing tools will make it easier to get started.\n\n## Tools\n\nThe following list includes tools used on Distiller for accessibility. This is by no means a comprehensive list, just what I used for a quick accessibility audit and ongoing development.

I can do that.” So it’s amazing to say that I was lucky enough to be selected and flown from Seattle to Melbourne for JSConf Australia on April 10. After submitting many unselected conference proposals, each one getting closer, my topic of Accessibility and the Shadow DOM finally broke through to a mainstream conference. I may have gotten a little help from Geoffrey Grosenbach (thanks, Geoff!) but I know my topic deserved to be there. I’ve worked hard [researching Web Components](http://substantial.com/blog/2014/02/05/accessibility-and-the-shadow-dom/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), experimenting with cutting-edge code, [interviewing people and writing](http://substantial.com/blog/2014/04/09/csun-accessibility-conference-recap/ \"Link opens in a new window\"). I have a lot to say. \\[Update\\] Thanks to Jared (@rioter) for the assurance that my talk was selected on its own merits.\n\n## A Little Background\n\nEver since Clay Johnson’s talk at Webstock where he mentioned people always choose _pizza_ over _broccoli_ when it comes to content on the Internet (ex. Kardashians vs. child hunger), I’ve thought of web accessibility as the _broccoli of web development_. How do you remind people they aren’t good at supporting marginalized members of society when they’d much rather hear about robots or WebSockets? When it’s phrased like that, I totally get it. Conferences are supposed to be fun; they lift you up and give you the inspiration needed for a series of uninterrupted months at work. The thing is, those months at work are the times when we need to remember web accessibility the most. Wouldn’t it be great if the inspiration came from conference talks tying web accessibility to modern code we do want to hear about?\n\n## Speaking at JSConfAU\n\nSpeaking to hundreds of people and being videotaped feels a bit like skydiving for 30 minutes. They mic you up, you make some jokes and then you're up there. Some of your intended jokes don't get any laughs, some do. You are responsible for curating the conversation the entire time. I thought teaching experience with Girl Develop It would help: it did help my confidence in getting up there, but I couldn't ask if something made sense and then explain it another way. And 30 minutes goes by _fast_.\n\nPart of the difficulty transitioning from speaking at meetups and code academies to a mainstream conference has to do with the audience. Accessibility and the Shadow DOM, as I initially structured it, began with accessibility background and then went into Shadow DOM. It was too technical for Refresh Seattle but worked great for a code academy. It's pretty obvious to me now that I should have skipped the background for JSConf and focused the entire 30 minutes on Shadow DOM. Fortunately, what seems like a big miss actually did a huge service to the accessibility community so I shouldn't feel bad. I'm still working out how to best structure a modern, mainstream accessibility talk (while trying not to be too hard on myself). JSConfAU felt like the beginning of something big, so I'm making an effort to make my talks more memorable. Here are some notes I made after the experience:\n\n- What's the one thing you want people to take away from your talk?\n- Don't hit people over the head with accessibility.\n- Really plan your talk for the audience. How technical are they? How much do they already know?\n- If you forget something, like introducing yourself, use notes next time.\n- Watch your timing.

I was excited to give my restructured talk to this mainstream audience: there were so many cool things about the topic that I wanted to share. Before it all happened, I wrote, \"If I do get the chance, I'll make sure to apply what I learned at JSConfAU.\"","src/content/posts/jsconf-2014-australia-accessibility-shadow-dom/index.mdx",[1111],"./2014-04-09_1397086704.jpg","fa168d8faa39284b","links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications",{"id":1113,"data":1115,"body":1120,"filePath":1121,"assetImports":1122,"digest":1124,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1116,"date":1117,"path":1118,"coverImage":1119},"Links vs. Buttons in Modern Web Applications",["Date","2016-07-09T00:00:00.000Z"],"/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./link-vs-button-featured.png","![Github interface buttons](./link-or-button-1.jpg)\n\nGithub: Links or buttons?\n\nSomething that comes up again and again in front-end accessibility is the issue of [links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) versus [buttons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button). You know, the HTML elements that open links in new windows or submit forms? In JavaScript web applications, it seems we're still confused about which element to choose for user interaction. To try and clarify the haziness, I'll define use cases for links and buttons in client-rendered applications and help you make better UI decisions, from design to development.\n\n## Buttons\n\nSomehow people become web developers without learning about the HTML `\u003Cbutton>` element. (I'll admit it took me a few years before I knew what h1-h6 headings were for, so it happens.) The mighty button is actually really cool. It can do all these things:\n\n- Receive keyboard focus by default\n- \"Click\" with the Space key\n- Submit form data to a server\n- Reset a form\n- Be disabled with the `disabled` attribute\n- Instruct a screen reader with the implicit `button` role\n- Show :focus, :hover, :active, :disabled\n\nWith a little scripting, a button is the perfect element for:\n\n- Opening a modal window\n- Triggering a popup menu\n- Toggling an interface\n- Playing media content\n- Inserting with JS if they only work with JS\n\n## Links\n\nHere are a few of the basic features of links, a.k.a. anchors, a.k.a. the foundation of the Web:\n\n- Create hypertext, a network of online resources\n- Navigate the user to a new page or view\n- Change the URL\n- Cause a browser redraw/refresh\n- Support page jumps with internal `href` attributes\n- Deep-link client-rendered applications\n- Are focusable by default with the `href` attribute\n- Register a click with the Enter key\n- Have the implicit `link` role\n- Can't be disabled like buttons but can be made inert with `tabindex=\"-1\"` and `aria-hidden=\"true\"`\n- Allow opening in new windows (and back in the day, framesets)\n- Show :link, :visited, :focus, :hover, :active\n\nThe starkest difference between a link and a button to me is that a link navigates the user to a new resource, taking them away from the current context (internal links are the only wrinkle here). A button toggles something in the interface, like a video player; or triggers new content in that same context, like a popup menu using `aria-haspopup`.\n\n### What is navigation? What is routing?\n\nChanging the URL means a user is navigating to a new page. It refreshes the browser with new resources and redrawn pixels. Navigation can be triggered with form actions, anchor links and JavaScript `location`.\n\nMuch like filtering in a mail room, routing is the mechanism for connecting network requests with the appropriate content in an application. Routers are common technology in various web development frameworks–I remember lusting at PHP ones early in my career–by mapping URL fragments with views and subviews. By writing dynamic routes, new content can be created without hard-coding.\n\n### Where does the confusion come from?\n\nIn the world of client-rendered web applications built with Angular, Ember or React, a browser redraw can be triggered at any time. It's somewhat hazy which element is right for the job when you can execute the same code as a route but with a button click handler and no URL change. For example, if I open a panel over the existing page content, am I navigating there or toggling the interface? Does it depend if the panel is deep-linked with a URL? Here's some code I saw recently:\n\n```\n\u003Ca href=\"#\" tabindex=\"0\" ng-click=\"userPicker.userClicked(true)\" aria-label=\"Some username\">\u003C/a>\n```\n\nMy immediate recommendation was to use a button element since there's no `href` value, but there is `tabindex=\"0\"` and an `ng-click` binding. It looks obvious, right? I got a response that it should remain an anchor because \"it routes to external page links and re-routes to profile pages.\" That would only be clear by studying the JavaScript code, which is invoked in many similar instances by `ng-click` bindings on button elements. Should it require such a deep analysis to recommend the right HTML element?\n\nIn a client-rendered app with proper focus management, the user may not be impacted by this–a link with `ng-click` and `tabindex` will still have the implicit link role. However, it would be much more declarative to use a populated `href` and routing if an anchor navigates the user to a new resource. Tabindex and click events tacked onto an anchor tag are a markup anti-pattern that will trip up future developers and code reviewers.\n\nMaking routing a core part of a web application makes it easier for developers to use links where appropriate and helps to clarify the purpose of buttons. It also makes it easier to create progressively-enhanced, server-rendered JavaScript applications using URL schemes instead of relying on click events.\n\n## The Role of UX in Accessible Development\n\nI'll say it out loud: this confusion often begins with Design and UX. A design comp comes to you with boxy interface buttons, and–because reasons–they have to be coded as links. Where does that become a problem?\n\nIf a screen reader user calls tech support and gets instructions to \"click the button\" in your UI that's really coded as a link, they may have trouble finding it. Also, consider voice interfaces: if you say a command to click a button but it's really coded as a link, you might have problems, no?\n\nFrameworks admittedly blur this line and make it easy to choose the wrong element, like the above `ng-click` example. We can use JavaScript to trigger asynchronous form submissions on any element we want (without a `form` tag, even, but you still need one). Similarly, we can initiate view changes without routing, even if it's best handled with link. Some elements are better for the job than others: it's all about taking advantage of the most native features of that element as possible.\n\n![Github with developer tools open showing buttons next to identical links](./github-1.png \"Open image in a new window\")\nCan you spot the difference?\n\n### What can we do about it?\n\nPush back on Design to make links look like links and buttons look like buttons. Removing the ambiguity makes it easier for developers to code more accessibly and better meet user expectations. _(Can I right-click this boxy button to open in a new window?)_\n\nIn development:\n\n- If a screen reader user tabbed onto an interactive element, would its role tell them what to expect? (Would it navigate away from the page? They'd want to know.)\n- Suppressing link features like URL changes or right click? Consider a button.\n- Encourage routing in your application with `href`, `ng-href`, etc.\n- Page navigation deserves title changes and history.\n\n### This isn't over.\n\nI'm sure this conversation will continue to swirl around into eternity, [as it has](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/anchors-without-href/6690/7) for [many years](http://www.webaxe.org/proper-use-buttons-links/). Each time you code an interface, you'll have to make a judgment call about which element is the correct one....and there are millions of ways to code the same thing. As long as you're making educated decisions, that's the best you can do.\n\nFor developers who work on the code after you, being declarative may help to educate them on this subject. And most importantly, consider your users' interaction expectations rather than getting _Radical™_ with interface design. Making intuitive interfaces reduces friction and keeps users happy.","src/content/posts/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications/index.mdx",[1123],"./link-vs-button-featured.png","78d90e8f214c4612","live-coding-accessibility",{"id":1125,"data":1127,"body":1132,"filePath":1133,"assetImports":1134,"digest":1136,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1128,"date":1129,"path":1130,"coverImage":1131},"Live Coding Accessibility",["Date","2018-06-28T00:00:00.000Z"],"/live-coding-accessibility","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./smashing-talk.jpg","![Me presenting Empathy Driven Development on stage at Smashing Conf Toronto](./smashing-talk-1024x768.jpg)\n\nPhoto by [Tiho Tadic](https://twitter.com/tihoni/status/1012015009881378817 \"Twitter opens in a new window\")\n\nThis year, I accepted a challenge from [Smashing Conference Toronto](https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2018 \"Smashing Conf opens in a new window\"): present a talk on live accessibility debugging with no slides. I thought this format sounded fantastic for attendees, as they'd be able to pick up tricks more naturally from industry leaders, seeing how they identify and solve problems in the moment.\n\nIt helps to see _how_ something is done to finish watching a talk feeling like: \"I can do this, too.\" For web accessibility in particular, I've gotten feedback that seeing hands-on coding is more helpful than simply hearing about it from a conceptual level. But…\n\n## “Why on Earth did I agree to do that?!”\n\nI accepted speaking at Smashing Toronto without second-guessing it, (incorrectly) assuming it would be less work to create a talk without any slides. In fact, prepping a no slides talk took just as much effort as a traditional presentation, if not more. It was certainly more stressful to prepare than I anticipated (hello, anxiety); however, the delivery was a lot more fun. Using a custom [React demo app](https://github.com/marcysutton/empathy-driven-development \"Opens in a new window\") for live debugging, in the end I felt like a more active participant going on an adventure with the audience. It was worth the effort and risk taking!\n\nFor your benefit as much as my own, I collected some thoughts and takeaways of things I learned from doing a series of live coding talks this year:\n\n## Don't forget the narrative\n\nI presented hybrid live-coding/with slides talks at [dotJS](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LdKjS94ugYI \"dotJS Youtube: opens in new window\"), [Beyond Tellerrand](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WTQAI9TzBx0 \"BT Conf Youtube: opens in new window\") and ScriptConf, before settling on a single no slides/live coding talk for [Uphill Conf](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wvGvJemoDHI \"Uphill Conf Youtube: opens in new window\"), [JSConf EU](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l95VFLj3e2w \"JS Conf Youtube: opens in new window\"), and Smashing Toronto. I learned more each time, but one of the biggest takeaways from all of them was that anything under 40 minutes is extremely difficult for this format.\n\nIn general, I like creating talk narratives with three major areas of focus, and that strategy simply falls apart at 18 or even 25 minutes due to the increased cognitive load of live coding. Time seems to get away from you much faster when you're tinkering and explaining things, and it's easy to forget important parts of the narrative.\n\nTwo things I noted to improve early on were to introduce myself better and to recap what we learned at the end. I rarely use speaker notes, so for me presentation slides usually act as a device to remember these things. Without them, it's easy to both start coding too fast and end the talk without enough of a summary. I go back and forth on the necessity of introducing myself when an emcee has already done it, especially for shorter talks (&lt;25 minutes)...but if the audience doesn't already know you, it helps to explain who you are and what you do. The wrap-up at the end is critical, though. Restate the main points of your talk, where to find resources, and how to contact you. It helps folks listening to prioritize information and solidify what they learned!\n\n## You can cheat for repeatable success\n\nI don't know about you, but for me it takes a lot more brain power to present 40 minutes of tested coding solutions and anecdotes than it does to tinker on a project in my free time. Maybe it's the time constraint, or maybe it's the stressed human response to being front of a large audience...but if I have to remember a whole project's worth of precise changes to make something accessible up on stage, it's a heavy cognitive load. Some coding tasks also take more time than you can reasonably spend while 300+ people are watching, such as typing out event listeners and boilerplate code.\n\nTo make things easier and faster, I found a few techniques for live coding talks that made the cognitive load more manageable, including:\n\n- Code snippets in Sublime Text (or your favorite text editor), where you can start typing and hit TAB to autocomplete the rest of the solution\n- Git tags for \"staged\" code solutions, which have the added benefit of helping people follow along on their own from the demo repository\n\nFor talks that are less technical in nature, half-finished materials that you can pick up to complete progress are a great way to go. It reminds me of cooking shows where they'd prep ahead or partially cook a recipe so they could show each step of the process in 22 minutes or whatever.\n\nIn [Gemma O'Brien's amazing talk](https://smashingconf.com/speakers/gemma-obrien \"Smashing Conf opens in a new window\") at Smashing Toronto on lettering and drawing, she had some partially-finished pieces to complete in front of us with ink on paper, which was both soothing and inspiring to watch. She also did a great job of describing how to hold her pens and writing tools, although saying \"it's easy\" made me chuckle because she was such a natural at it. :)\n\n![](./gemma-obrien-1024x768.jpg)\n\nGemma O'Brien doing live calligraphy at Smashing Toronto, photo by Patricia Basuel - [@pbasuel](https://twitter.com/pbasuel/status/1012044502574489601)\n\n## Describe your actions in detail\n\nThis applies to regular talks and coding screencasts, as well: describe what you're coding or doing on your computer so people can follow along. In a live coding talk you have to fill the time while actively typing or debugging, ideally without periods of silence. Describe your keyboard shortcuts, tools already installed, things you tried previously, etc.\n\nThe best reason to do this in any kind of presentation is one that I've considered from day one for accessibility purposes: without saying aloud what's happening on the screen, blind and low vision folks can't follow along. It also helps if a video recording misses what's happening on the screen, like in my [first talk at JSConf](https://marcysutton.com/summing-up-jsconf-eu-2014/).\n\n## Things I wish had gone differently\n\nI wish I'd had more time to show additional techniques, especially in the shorter length versions...but I can appreciate that a 25 minute talk is easier to sit through as an audience member.\n\nI ran into limitations with JavaScript tools for automated accessibility testing, leaving me to wonder if people would actually go the distance to implement it into their own projects. But rather than feel dejected, I decided it would be my mission to make these kinds of things easier by opening issues against testing frameworks and creating snippets for people to get up and running.\n\n### Accessibility testing takeaways for future reference\n\n- Issue 1: you can't trigger a button click with the Enter key in [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/441#issuecomment-398278568 \"Opens in a new window\") like you can in Selenium Webdriver\n- Issue 1a: [Simulant](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/simulant \"Opens in a new window\") wouldn't trigger events in React for me, likely because they were bound to individual DOM nodes and not delegated in the same way as React's Synthetic Event\n- Issue 2: focus management in React after a CSS transition requires a setTimeout, and/or some other kind of [wizardry in your test suite](https://twitter.com/brianskold/status/1009383639379922944 \"Opens in a new window\")\n- Issue 3: Selenium Webdriver's JavaScript docs are seriously lacking\n    - Promise-based everything is hard to implement when things don't logistically chain (i.e. comparing the activeElement to some other element)\n    - This became somewhat easier using async/await in my tests, but that made debugging test failures much more difficult\n\nOne other thing I wish I had more time for: multiple versions of my demos in other JS frameworks, or without a JS framework. [Ryan Florence's JSConf talk](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CBhDdWY1uv8 \"Opens in a new window\") comes to mind. I was balancing my job and life with these talks and couldn't even think of doing that…but with more time and a [shift in focus](https://marcysutton.com/chapter-two-at-deque/), perhaps I can recreate them in Angular or Vue.\n\n### Do better\n\nLastly, this goes beyond live coding talks or even work in general: don't let mistakes or emotions rule so much of my productivity. It's really depressing out there in the world, and sometimes I have conflicts or disagreements with people. If I keep letting self-hate or stuff out of my control slow me to a crawl, I'll never get enough done to feel satisfied. Emotional hijacking gets in the way of my real objectives, like making the web a better place.\n\nReading The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\*\\*\\* really helped me to prioritize better values, and \"social media presence\" is not one of those. Being helpful, kind and understanding is (even if people don't know the whole story, it doesn't really matter. Yes, I'm being intentionally vague here).\n\n## Thanks for the opportunities & champions\n\nAfter four solid years of public speaking, I'm taking the rest of this year off for personal growth and recovery. I'm appreciative of all the opportunities I've gotten, even if I couldn't accept every single one. When I look back to [where I started](https://marcysutton.com/jsconf-2014-australia-accessibility-shadow-dom/) as a total newb, completing a series of live coding talks feels like a big achievement.\n\n> If you're a speaker looking to get out there and move the needle on accessibility, [please let me know](https://marcysutton.com/contact/) so I can recommend you!\n\nEach time I hear someone say \"I'm more motivated about accessibility now after your talk\", or \"I never even knew accessibility was a thing before this\" it makes me happy beyond belief. More importantly, I've seen a number of new accessibility champions rise up in the past few years after becoming acquainted at mainstream conferences like JSConf, and it brings the biggest smile to my face every single time. To those of you making accessibility efforts large and small, you are making a difference.

To go to CSUN is to be reminded of how much there is to learn about accessibility. A large community comes together, sharing knowledge and experiences from around the field. We all come at it from different directions, but it's wonderful to be in the company of people who care deeply about making the web accessible to all.\n\nCSUN is an opportunity to learn about lesser-known areas like cognitive accessibility, a very popular topic this year, and to attend sessions relevant to your own slice of things. There are hundreds of overlapping talks, so it takes a bit of planning and luck to find the best ones. This year the sessions filled up insanely fast and I unfortunately missed some that I wanted to attend, including one on Angular, Accessibility and SVG. Many people also said they were unable to get into my talk on Developments in Angular Accessibility ([slides](https://marcy.codes/slides/angular-a11y-csun \"Link opens in a new window\")), along with a ton of others. Hopefully the organizers will find a better solution for assigning rooms at next year's event. Perhaps we show popularity for a session by adding it to our schedule!\n\nIn many ways, conferences help us to gain perspective from other people. A big takeaway for me at CSUN this year was to regularly test with real users on projects (it seems so obvious when said out loud), including those with disabilities. On Angular Material, we have tons of people using our components in the open source community. Their participation is certainly a start to finding issues with usability, as they will be reported, but they are development consumers. They know too much about how things are built and what to expect when using the interface. By testing with people less familiar with the UI framework and iterating on their findings, we can pass the benefits on to all our users. As I learned from a great session on open source, there are also things we can do to make our build process more accessible to encourage participation by people with disabilities.\n\nI also realized the need to expand my technical testing horizons, as there are gaps in my current matrix–really cool stuff, too, like Dragon Naturally Speaking, high-contrast media queries and the Web Speech API. While learning techniques to do our jobs better, it's also important to look ahead to new technologies and how they might help accessibility. We could perhaps build integrations for the Apple Watch or Nest Thermostat, or make futuristic gesture-controlled apps using the [Myo armband](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/ \"Link opens in a new window\") or Leap Motion. I personally love hearing about new uses of technology that people's lives better.\n\nOne amazing example of an experimental technology shown at CSUN this year was Doug Schepers' SVG screen reader, [Describler](https://github.com/shepazu/describler \"Link opens in a new window\"). It wasn't an official session, but rather a hallway-track demo he pulled up on a laptop for anyone who asked. The project synthesized alternative content for SVG charts using the Web Audio API and JavaScript, reading aloud information about data trends as you interacted with the app. It was a well-executed and imaginative interface that looked like a possible new direction for screen readers. The app programmatically announced data point comparisons, making visual data easier to digest for users with low-vision or cognitive disabilities...heck, after a few drinks it would be quite welcome. As a member of the W3C, Doug mentioned a goal of the project was to dream big in its feature set and potentially put pressure on screen reader designers. As developers, we agreed that assistive technologies would really benefit from standards just like browsers have, but perhaps simpler, with easy wins to start. Assistive technology standards could be a way for the community to develop user experiences like these and push for them to be adopted.\n\nIn addition to new research and project ideas, I learned some neat tricks for development, including an `aria-labelledby` technique from Karl Groves & Billy Gregory where you can properly label \"Read more\" links using multiple IDs:\n\n```\n\u003Ch1 id=\"articleHeading1\">Cupcake Ipsum\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Gummies biscuit chocolate cake sesame snaps marzipan I love I love. \n\u003Ca href=\"cupcake.html\" id=\"articleLink1\" \n   aria-labelledby=\"articleHeading1 articleLink1\">\n   Read more\n\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n```\n\n[Read More links with multiple label sources on Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/marcysutton/pen/JoaVrX \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nIn the above code, a vague \"read more\" link is made more descriptive for screen readers using two space-separated IDs: from the link itself and a neighboring heading, bound with ARIA-labelledby. It is then read aloud as \"Cupcake Ipsum Read More\". I hadn't seen this self-referential ID trick before, and it was a reminder of how `aria-labelledby` will effectively replace the accessible name on an element with a reference to another (try removing the `articleLink1` reference on Codepen to hear \"Read more\" go away entirely). This trick can be used to combine label contexts together. It is important to know what ARIA is doing, however, especially when it comes to [accessible name calculation](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#namecalculation \"Link opens in a new window\"). When I get ahold of Billy and Karl's slides, I'll post them here.\n\nAlthough conflicting with the last few sessions at CSUN, Friday was fantastic as we got outside for a tandem bike adventure. Elle Waters from Simply Accessible helped me organize the small, sponsored event where we ventured down to the Wheels of Fun location on the Seaport Harbor. On 5 or 6 tandem bicycles, we paired up as sighted and visually-impaired cyclists for an afternoon in the sun. I rode with Laura Legendary, a visually impaired friend from Nevada, and we had a grand old time. I was happy she trusted me to pilot her up and down the boardwalk, even over a big bump protecting a giant hose running down to a giant yacht. We giggled and cooed, and Laura glowingly said she \"felt free\", as if she was five-years-old again and the luckiest person on the face of the planet. I felt the same–incredibly lucky to participate and share my passion for biking with a new group. Now that we've pulled off the first iteration and learned a few things, I look forward to repeating the tandem bike event and the rest of CSUN next year!\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_gtDVAVEAAFJk7.jpg)\n\nLaura Legendary stands by in her helmet as Steve Sawczyn and Elle Waters try out a tandem bicycle at Wheels of Fun Rentals at the Marriott hotel in San Diego.","src/content/posts/notes-from-csun-2015/index.mdx",[1147],"./tandem-biking.jpg","ea11331162ad6c92","one-year-of-independence-modern-sole-design-llc",{"id":1149,"data":1151,"body":1158,"filePath":1159,"assetImports":1160,"digest":1162,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1152,"date":1153,"path":1154,"coverImage":1155,"excerpt":1156,"shortTitle":1157},"Celebrating One Year of Independence as Modern Sole Design, LLC",["Date","2021-10-25T00:00:00.000Z"],"/one-year-of-independence-modern-sole-design-llc","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./backpacking.jpg","One year ago I started an independent accessible web development business.

I worked with a local attorney to develop my company’s operating agreement and initial annual report in the State of Washington (which I just renewed, one year later). It was a bit scary and took a leap of faith to leave full-time employment behind but I’m happy to report that after a year in business, _Marcy Sutton the freelancer_ is really thriving.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n    ![Sitting at a remote lake with yellow larches at sunrise and my camping cup in my hand.](./backpacking.jpg)\n    \n    \u003Cfigcaption>Taking time away from the computer in month 1 for a solo backpacking trip.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nSince September 2020, I’ve worked with numerous clients on projects specific to their needs. I worked on automated accessibility testing for Tenon, accessibility engineering for the open source platform Forem, product consulting and developer relations for Evinced, accessibility office hours for Substantial, accessibility training for Microsoft and Google, as well as accessibility engineering for a meat delivery service.\n\nI love having a focus on accessibility as an independent lead-level web developer with knowledge to share. Over time I’ve fine-tuned my engagements to do more of the work I want to do and less of the stuff I don’t, which is also in my clients’ best interest. Increasingly, by taking an active role in guiding my deliverables toward accessibility engineering, I’ve gotten to work on things I really enjoy. As a result, my career feels healthy and sustainable for the first time in years.\n\nIndependence is not without its stresses. It was a lot of work to get a business up and running while contributing new work at the same time during a global pandemic. To be honest, I ran on adrenaline for most of the first year to make sure I could survive. I pondered whether I would ever go back to full-time work on a team as compelling roles came up and contacts reached out. And yet, I kept moving forward. I was challenged, invigorated and empowered to fulfill my own career destiny. My only wish is that I would have done it sooner.\n\n## Pros and cons\n\nThe biggest advantage: I am my own boss and I am responsible for my own output and customer satisfaction. I don’t worry about mismanagement, big egos, organizational friction, or any of the expectations or misalignments that contributed to feeling burned out as an idealistic woman in the tech industry.\n\nAnother advantage: I love the flexibility of working part time. I no longer feel like my time on this Earth is being wasted when things are a bit slow. I just do something else that day, starting with a workout. Scheduling freedom and a smaller workload have been huge contributors to my improving mental clarity, health, and energy. Life really is short and I am a happier person with a better work-life balance. For real, though.\n\nThere are definitely drawbacks, too. Although I got a glimpse on my last contract, I miss the camaraderie of working with teams. I miss people in general and really felt isolated around the holidays last year.\n\nI also pay a lot more in self-employment taxes in the United States than I would pay in taxes as an employee. Still, I chose to create a [single-member LLC](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/single-member-limited-liability-companies) to simplify my taxes with a single personal tax return that I file with the help of an accountant. Since I prefer working alone and don’t plan to hire any employees, this made sense. I may shift to an [S-Corp structure](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations) in the future but that would require monthly or quarterly payroll taxes and a lot more business admin work. For my current part-time effort, it doesn’t seem worth it. But someday it might.\n\nAnother drawback: my contracts are hourly so I am probably missing out on some income I could earn on more of a project-basis (I’m open to advice here!). For example, my friend Jason Lengstorf told me he charged a flat fee for a week of work but that sounded like more of a full-time gig in a week-by-week disguise. I am carefully protecting my health and freedom from overwork now that I’m mostly [healed from burnout](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/1292971874570256385).\n\nHere’s something I wasn’t expecting: banks require 2 years of tax returns for a mortgage or a mortgage refinance. If you are considering going independent from a full-time gig, it would really help to get a mortgage or other big financial thing lined up first. I did a refinance on my house in 2021 to take advantage of the historically low rates and I had to get my Mom to cosign despite qualifying on my own originally and making the payments myself. I had the privilege of being able to ask for her help and I’m grateful. But it was still unexpected and I’ll have to consider it as long as my partner and I both stay independent. I pay for my own health insurance and business insurance policies, as well.\n\nThere has been another great part of starting a consulting business during COVID: I haven’t needed to travel for client work or public speaking at all. It’s had a positive effect on my finances and my mental and physical health as I’m at home every day or traveling for fun instead. I took ample time away from conferences and public speaking to make sure my business was viable and to heal through some major life changes. As I ramp back up with public speaking and upcoming events including [CascadiaJS](https://2021.cascadiajs.com/workshops/marcy-sutton) and [SmashingConf SF](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/1452698267586756608), I’m so thankful for the past (nearly) 2 years of rest.\n\n## Moving forward\n\nLooking to the future, I plan to gear my billable projects toward the work I’m best at: accessibility engineering, including tinkering with user interfaces and improving digital access. I want to provide code as deliverables rather than spreadsheets (e.g. not doing accessibility audits). Even though I have zero fear in front of an audience and enjoy presenting, I don’t want to be a \"TV personality\" that simply hosts events. Instead, I want to use my talents to solve user interface problems and inspire designers and developers to do the same.\n\nFor the rest of 2021 and into part of 2022, my focus will be entirely on accessibility workshops including my independent series, Testing Accessibility. The next live workshop on [Automated Accessibility Testing](https://testingaccessibility.com/workshops/automated-accessibility-testing) will occur on November 17. You can view the entire workshop schedule and join my mailing list to receive discounts over on the website as I launch new things: [testingaccessibility.com](https://testingaccessibility.com).\n\nI will be looking for my next billable client by Q2 of 2022.

As if that wasn't breathtaking enough on its own, my fellow award-winners were none other than [Molly Holzschlag](https://about.me/mollydotcom \"Link opens in a new window\") and [Alex Russell](http://infrequently.org/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), two web champions I still can't believe are my colleagues.\n\nWhen I started out in web development after pivoting from photojournalism, I had a fire lit inside that carried me up, and up, and up. At various points along the way I became aware of issues in the industry, including gender imbalance and the need for accessible web interfaces. Being a problem solver, I set out to improve those things in whatever way I could. I questioned wanting to \"be the accessibility girl\" at one point, however, my [first CSUN conference](/csun-accessibility-conference-recap/) forever changed my outlook. I forged ahead in supporting Girl Develop It to personally encourage more women to join me in this industry. And I [worked accessibility into every project](/how-i-audit-a-website-for-accessibility/) I could, budgeted or not, because I cared about it deeply.\n\nTo be recognized by an organization like O'Reilly (despite some rather unfortunate things going on there), I am humbled, strengthened, excited, and honored. I have an extra bounce in my step knowing that my path has been well chosen. I recently changed jobs to follow my heart and passion, and it feels like the right decision ever more. (It feels really good to have [recognition from my employer](https://twitter.com/dylanbarrell/status/708063649902886912 \"Link opens in a new window\"), too.)\n\nThank you for your support, web community. I never would have thought my career would be this successful when I was an art student banging my head against the wall learning Actionscript. Staying true to oneself is so important–identify your strengths and follow your heart. With a little bit of luck (and sometimes privilege), the world is your oyster. Give back when you can, and you will be rewarded–I now wake up every day happy, knowing I'm paying it forward.

I looked up a few demos for inspiration, and found these:\n\n- [iOS Style Sliding Menu on Codepen](http://codepen.io/jasonhowmans/pen/dykhL \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- [Sitepoint Pure CSS Off-Screen Navigation Menu](http://www.sitepoint.com/pure-css-off-screen-navigation-menu/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nI could see it wouldn't be too difficult to code a basic slide menu using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (I wasn't a fan of the CSS-only solution). The trick was making it accessible using keyboards and screen readers. I thought I had a workable solution, and then I discovered a big problem: pages weren't scrollable in mobile Voiceover with [3-finger swipe](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/TestingAccessibilityOfiOSApps/TestAccessibilityonYourDevicewithVoiceOver/TestAccessibilityonYourDevicewithVoiceOver.html \"Link opens in a new window\")! It made reading articles impossible, since they always read \"page 1 of 1\", even though there were clearly more pages. So I set out to fix it. Read on for the solution and check out my Codepen demo below to see the finished result!\n\n## Logical source order\n\nThe slide effect required a `nav` outside of the main `#content` wrapper so each element could be positioned independently and animated. My first challenge was creating a logical page structure while keeping my design aesthetic...I wondered, _should my nav come first in the document or last?_ I settled on first, since the links were visually at the top. My desired tab order was the site logo link, then the menu button, the menu links (when open) and the rest of the main content. To accomplish this, I added `tabindex=\"1\"` to the site logo link and `tabindex=\"2\"` to the hamburger button so they always came first in the tab order. Then the rest of the content followed. This is breaking the general rule that you should avoid positive integer tabindex values, but I did it for a specific keyboard order. [Read more about tabindex](http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/08/using-the-tabindex-attribute/ \"Link opens in a new window\").\n\n## Managing visibility & focus\n\nWhile the nav was visually hidden, I set `aria-hidden=\"true\"` on it and `tabindex=\"-1\"` on the child links. I wrote some JavaScript to update those attributes, hiding and unhiding them as the menu was toggled. To work with the document source order required by the sliding pattern, I also managed focus when the menu was toggled: hit SPACE on the menu button when closed and see focus sent into the first menu link. Hit ESC anywhere in the menu to see focus sent back to the menu button. (An alternative to managing tabindex and aria-hidden would be to use `display:none` after animating.)\n\nFor screen readers, I established an ARIA relationship between the nav and button using `\u003Cbutton aria-controls=\"navId\" aria-haspopup=\"true\">` and `\u003Cnav id=\"navId\">`. I also toggled the text \"Menu collapsed\" and \"Menu expanded\" on the button using `aria-label` and JavaScript since it was more reliable than `aria-expanded`. I'm hard-coding the text in JavaScript, but I might do it differently if I had to support internationalization.\n\n## The Mobile Voiceover Bug\n\nMany of the demos I found used `position:fixed;` or `absolute` on the main content area with CSS overflow to scroll the content and some basic animations to slide in the menu. When I checked my first iteration in mobile VoiceOver, the screen reader on iOS devices, I found a major bug where pages wouldn't scroll. D'oh!\n\nWhen browsing mobile optimized webpages, Voiceover normally calculates and announces the number of screens on a given page (\"page 1 of 3\", \"page 2 of 5\", etc.). Pages on my site that clearly spanned more than one screen length were always announced as \"page 1 of 1\" and they wouldn't scroll. It worked fine in Chrome for Android though–I had stumbled upon a bug in Voiceover related to fixed/absolute positioning in CSS.\n\n## The fix\n\nThe trick to making pages scrollable in mobile Voiceover is to keep main content areas in the normal document flow using `position:relative`, not `absolute`. (I think `overflow:hidden` and `max-height:100%` on the body element causes problems too, but I need to do more research.) The `nav` _can_ use fixed positioning and slide in next to the rest of the content. One limitation is that a menu that also overflows the page height probably won't scroll in Voiceover, as it will suffer from the original positioning bug.\n\nThe fix was simple enough, but I suspect this issue is present all over the Web. I've seen a ton of websites and web-apps using fixed or absolute CSS positioning on the main content area, and barely anyone tests in mobile screen readers. Let's change that! Here are some [testing tips from Henny Swan](http://www.iheni.com/talk-is-cheap-screen-reader-testing-on-mobile/ \"Link opens in a new window\"). They're from 2011, but still relevant. TalkBack on Android has gotten a lot better, too.\n\nThis is one instance where mobile web accessibility can be easily wrong, and even I had trouble with it at first. It would be awesome to get a bug report filed with Apple. For now, to make it easier to create an accessible slide menu, I've abstracted mine into a demo on Codepen. I encourage you to test it in Voiceover to see for yourself! Here is a [setup tip](http://www.applevis.com/guides/toggling-voiceover-and-using-triple-click-home-shortcut \"Link opens in a new window\").\n\n_Update: Here's the Webkit bug report!

Since we could write code for modern browsers only (no Internet Explorer, yessss!), my mind ran wild with all the possibilities.\n\nI decided to query the Flickr API and make a location & time-based photo clock. I teamed up with [Nick Thiel](http://twitter.com/nickthiel), former POP Art Director; we brainstormed a bit about how the idea might look, focusing on functional design communication. Nick's design works very well, informing the user of both function of the clock and the relationship of the images.\n\nIn just under a week, I coded the Javascript clock logic and layout markup, incorporated the [Flickr API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) via JSON-P and used [@font-face](http://www.miltonbayer.com/font-face/) for the first time (so easy & quick to render!). I also got nitty-gritty with jQuery optimization & the prototype design pattern and lastly, I added a city-picker that allows users to choose slideshow destinations.

There's no requirement to work in a distracting open office. You can live where you want within your budget, and do more meaningful activities on your breaks. How about starting a load of laundry? Or going outside for fresh air? Doing office yoga with the dog? Microwaving fish for lunch? You can do all of the above.\n\nIn my opinion, the most amazing benefit of remote technology work is the freedom to do your job from anywhere with an internet connection. In the past few years, I've worked remotely for periods of time ranging from a few days to a few weeks in 4x4 vans. They're perfect adventure vehicles.\n\n![Iceberg the Beefy at sunset with the moon rising](./images/van-sunset.jpg)\n\nIn this post, I'll share how I made van life work with a full-time job as an engineering manager for a remote website startup. It wasn't always easy, and was very much **not a vacation** during work time. Still, it's a privilege to be able to choose this lifestyle, as not everyone has that luxury. I've gotten to go the back way to places and chase the winter storms and sunny weather I've always dreamed of. With some planning, discipline, and a work/life situation that allows you to get away, it is possible to work remotely on the road and break up your regular routine.\n\n## What prompted this lifestyle?\n\nEver since a close friend of mine got a 4x4 van (pronounced \"four-by-four\") and started going on multi-day adventures to ski areas and mountain bike trailheads, I wanted to change my lifestyle of staying in one place or booking hotels for trips. I'd gone camping quite a few times before, but there was something alluring about adventuring in a van; it seemed more my style.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Snow piled up on our van after a big storm in the Revelstoke parking lot](./images/revelstoke-dumpage.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>I conducted a technical interview for a marketing manager candidate from the Revelstoke, BC parking lot.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nSnowboarding's been my favorite activity for over 20 years, and having an all-wheel drive vehicle and financial means made that possible. As I got more into cycling in my 20's, I yearned to get out on more trips to places I hadn't been before (Moab, Utah, in particular). I carried a tent in my car and camped for some of those activities, but admittedly not snow camping–I sleep better when I'm not on the edge of freezing all night.\n\nThere's endless terrain to ride, hike, and explore around the Pacific Northwest, and I realized that to experience it at the pace I wanted (e.g. arrive in a ski area parking lot the night before a big dump of snow), I'd have to invest in a better camping vehicle and be willing to skip a few showers.\n\n## Making it work\n\nWhile an absolute joy and a privilege, remote work and van life isn't easy. First of all, I didn't have a toilet inside a van in my earlier life. Or a shower, though we had a completely different setup on our wish list. I always look like a hot mess if I try to call into a video meeting after a few days fully off the grid. I wear hats and don't wear much makeup, but my skin is happier and it's less wasteful anyway. I use a lot of hand sanitizer and have employed a portable toilet with a dedicated outdoor tent, but those were way more difficult to use in crappy weather. I found places to pay for showers every few days, and will always bring thong sandals to wear in the shower.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: inline-block; width: 49%;\">\n\n![Me calling into a meeting in the van with Rainier the labradoodle in the driver's seat](./images/prescott-meeting-life.jpg)\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: inline-block; margin-left: 1%; width: 49%;\">\n\n![My dusty laptop in the van as we drove into Glen Canyon recreation area](./images/glen-canyon-blog-post.jpg)\n\n\u003C/div>\n\nIt's expensive to fuel and maintain an overland vehicle on top of a house, particularly a big custom diesel van that gets wear and tear from constant use. It also costs a lot to use my mobile phone data plan after a couple of weeks on the road, as an average work day for me includes a lot of browser tabs, video calls, and package manager installs. Even so, I choose to spend time on the road and feel fortunate to have that flexibility.\n\nFor folks who live in their vans full-time (I don't), there's always a fear that your belongings could be stolen or damaged if you aren't watching them. There are also lots of [people who live in their vehicles](https://www.seattlemet.com/news-and-city-life/2018/11/more-homeless-seattleites-live-in-their-vehicles-than-ever-before) on city streets full-time due to rising housing costs; where I grew up in Seattle comes to mind. Also, if you have to take a vehicle home in for service, you're out of a house until you get it back. If you can work on your own vehicle, you still need shop space to do it, and it can be costly and time-consuming.\n\nRemote work on the road requires a reliable vehicle (and some good luck) to not let you down when you're rushing to find cell reception to meet a virtual commitment or project deadline. I can't take meetings while sitting as a passenger because there's a high probability that my signal will drop, and it's important to avoid disruptions. I only get motion sickness occasionally, but some people can't work in a moving vehicle at all. It's also very sedentary sometimes; that's why bringing bicycles or going on hikes is so nice.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Our van parked at Slipper Arch with the doors open and my mountain bike leaning against it](./images/van-arch-bike-camp.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>A trip where I was notably not working\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nMoving vehicles are also quite loud, particularly beefy Ford vans. So I've stayed stationary while meetings were going on, and increasingly that was a lot of my work week as a manager. I consolidated meetings onto Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday with scheduled lunch breaks, which required downtime somewhere with decent WIFI for me to do my best work. On a trip to Arizona, I booked 2 affordable Airbnbs for a few days during the week so I could have some quiet and stability and my partner could continue exploring, which made a longer trip possible but definitely added to the cost.\n\n## Our adventure rig setup\n\nWhen I met my then-partner Marcus in 2015, we talked about the places we wanted to go in the world and went on car/truck camping road trips. He'd built custom offroad rigs and gone overland motorcycling for years, and I happened to have a motorcycle license. We schemed doing longer trips together, but I was traveling a lot as a public speaker (as evidenced by my [talks](/talks) page) and needing downtime at home.\n\nAbout a year into our relationship he bought a 2-wheel-drive van and converted it to 4x4 himself, making it beefier and more capable with 37\" tires and custom front and rear bumpers housing recovery equipment, hitch mounts, furnace and cooking fuel, a full-size spare, generator box, and bike rack. I also put in a queen-size memory foam mattress and a Webasto diesel furnace that made it comfortable.\n\nI came to see a van as a superior overland vehicle compared to motorcycles. I could bring the dog, sleep in comfort all year long, and stow plenty of gear and tools (including a kitchen kit to cook food: I eat pretty well in the middle of nowhere!). I've been able to carry a tripod and camera gear, and rekindle my love for night photography. A van also unlocked the real possibility of remote work for me once I experienced a good \"house\" electrical setup. I can work on a laptop in the van even when it's raining or snowing outside.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![The night sky at the Alvord Desert with our van encircled by a red headlamp in a long exposure](./images/alvord-lightup1.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>Night photography in the Alvord Desert, Oregon\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Electrical power and data usage\n\nIceberg the Beefy's electrical setup included an inverter charger and 3 house batteries that regenerate with an automatic charging relay while driving, or off a generator or solar panel in full sun when parked. It can also plug in to \"shore power\". This setup enabled me to plug in my laptop and charge devices. Marcus also talked me into getting a TV and DVD player, which ran off the inverter charger and were honestly pretty awesome on dark snowy nights. My friend's van became the dining car and ours became the living room with the front chairs swiveled around: ski area parking lot dreams realized.\n\n![Our two vans in the snowy Heather Meadows parking lot](./images/heather-meadows-jay.jpg)\n\nGatsby, my employer at the time, provided a $500 home office credit which I invested into a [WeBoost RV cell booster](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N705CF3/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that ran off the inverter and helped with connectivity in the van (but it can't invent a network when there is none or when it's overloaded, like a busy day at Mt. Baker Ski Area). I still use my iPhone as a mobile hotspot and it's enough hardware for me to hold remote meetings from anywhere with a good signal. It can definitely create an expensive AT&T phone bill at the end of the month, especially in Canada or other countries with a $10 a day charge to use a regular plan internationally. So I do that sparingly and work offline, or find WIFI.\n\nI'll probably get a dedicated mobile hotspot like I've heard other full-time van lifers do, so I'm not hammering my phone bill with data usage. I deduct 100% of my phone and internet cost from taxes, and I've had past employers subsidize $100 a month for each of those. Still, when I'm aren't at home, I'm not using the high-performance internet I'm paying for...and it's not good or wise to waste money in the pursuit of freedom. This is where long-term choices are important to sustain my desired lifestyle.\n\n![The inside of our van with the doors and windows open, with Rainier the labradoodle on the bed and my laptop in my lap](./images/van-working-rainier-tshirt-annotated.jpg)\n\nAn [ARB fridge](https://arbusa.com/portable-fridge-freezers/) kept food and drinks cold when out in the middle of nowhere, which is great as I love to cook up hot meals. We'd talked about getting a microwave like a friend and his van, but we got by with a Coleman 2-burner propane stove outside and a Jetboil. There was also a stove and sink in that van that weren't fully set up. I couldn't really tell you why other than it wasn't a priority and we didn't want our clothes to smell like onions. I will likely get a microwave or oven in my next rig build, since it can be useful for reheating food. (I still wouldn't force microwaved fish on anyone in a tight space.)\n\n## Dreams\n\nVan life is something I cherish after wanting to go on adventures so badly in years past. Looking to the next 5-10 years of life, I feel committed to building #vanlife even more into my lifestyle because I'm so dang happy when I'm out on the road. Since I have a remote job, I intend to enjoy the opportunity as much as possible.\n\nI haven't prioritized this lifestyle in past life decisions, as evidenced by my home mortgage. To do as much van life-ing as I dream about when the weather sucks locally or I'm on our way home from a great trip and I don't want it to end, it would require some downsizing to my home and financial commitment. That's the beauty of developing life goals and making different choices for a purpose: they give you something to work toward and dream about. So I'll continue going out on the road when I can afford it, and going back to my home base and shop when I need to rebuild and regroup.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![A group of rigs at Lake Powell](./images/ridgway-trip-lake-powell.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nPictured above: a Southern Utah trip led by [Chris Ridgway](https://instagram.com/the_ridge_way) and profiled by [Harry Wagner](https://instagram.com/harrysituations) in [Four Wheeler Magazine: Overlanding and Off-roading in 4x4 conversion vans](https://www.fourwheeler.com/news/features/2001-overlanding-off-roading-4x4-conversion-vans/)\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nAfter giving a lot of myself to my career for the past 10 years, including 6 years of international public speaking and accessibility evangelism, it feels amazing to prioritize something else for a change. I traveled a lot as part of my job as Head of Learning at Gatsby, and still remote do talks and workshops from time to time. But after burning out multiple times in my career, my priorities have shifted. I've reclaimed my time in some of the best years of life, and I look forward to an inevitably adventurous future.\n\nMaybe some day I'll get out long enough to drive to other countries, and get all the way down to South America. I'll be in a newer custom rig by then, as that's on my \"vision board\" so to speak. It's also in reach with some very deliberate choices. I'm a big fan of going the back way to places, like up a mountain on a through-route to the other side, and better facilities and an ergonomic living setup will enable me to go deeper and farther. Sounds like a dream design project to me.\n\n![Our van and motorcycle trailer parked in the desert in California, with the clamshell door open and stairs out.

International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference](http://csunconference.org \"Link opens in a new window\") put on by the California State University Northridge Center on Disabilities. We'll refer to it as _CSUN_, for short. When I first heard about the conference, I was intrigued to find out it had existed for so many years–I thought it must have quite a legacy. With butterflies in my stomach, I decided to make my first trip to CSUN. Traveling solo and paying my own way, I booked a \"bed & bike\" on Airbnb that came with access to an older steel bicycle I could ride to the conference each day, a 10 minute ride across downtown. Like a total bike nerd, I brought my own helmet, hand pump, U-lock and lights. I had a delightful time exploring the city by myself. It was warm, as Southern California generally is in February, compared to Seattle where I live. Although I didn't ride far due to the fit and condition of the bike, San Diego was fun to ride. I felt empowered and fulfilled.\n\nAt the conference hotel, the Grand Hyatt–where I figured out one could stash a giant bike bag–I spent 4 days learning from experts about one of my passions: accessibility. I made new friends and acquaintances that week, including two blind folks I got to join on walks arm-in-arm down to the hotel coffee shop to chat about web tech: Léonie Watson and Marco Zehe. Hearing their perspectives first-hand blew me away. There were plans for a tandem bike adventure, for which I was enthusiastically ready to pilot visually-impaired people with my helmet. (It didn't happen in 2014, but we're trying again this year.) Each night after way too much fun, I biked back to my cute little house by the downtown freeway, once getting a flat tire that I pumped up just enough to make it home. I was pretty excited about biking in new cities and made a point to do it more often.\n\n![My ancient rented bicycle](./2014-03-18_1395167761.jpg)\n\n> “I rode a bike to the accessibility conference. The seat is up as high as it goes.” #CSUN14\n\nIn the year since, I [reflected a lot](http://substantial.com/blog/2014/04/09/csun-accessibility-conference-recap/ \"Link opens in a new window\") on different parts of that experience, including what I'd learned, how I presented myself, and how I'd like to contribute back to a community that's close to my heart. As it came time to book travel this year, I asked myself a tough question: _is it insensitive to be excited about biking to an accessibility conference?_\n\nI started working in accessibility through my previous job as a front-end developer at [POP](http://popagency.com \"Link opens in a new window\"), a digital agency. I didn't know anyone with a disability until I became acquainted with Target's accessibility team on client projects. We worked so well together; I learned a lot from them. In 2012, a blind colleague from Target, Steve Sawczyn, started following me on Twitter and after I got over the feeling of _oh geeze...a client is following me,_ we became friends. I thought a lot about what his web browsing experience might be like. “He won't be able to read the text in those silly meme graphics,\" I thought. “I can't retweet that photo without having to explain the entire joke, thus killing it.” I've never stopped thinking about accessible communication since then. Meeting people with disabilities made me curious and compassionate.\n\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-cards=\"hidden\" lang=\"en\">\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/steveofmaine\">@steveofmaine\u003C/a> I had a good chuckle the other day thinking about how to make fartscroll.js accessible to the deaf: \u003Ca href=\"https://t.co/vpH2u54Ry2\">https://t.co/vpH2u54Ry2\u003C/a>\u003C/p>— Marcy Sutton (@marcysutton) \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/333323538574487553\">May 11, 2013\u003C/a>\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cscript async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\">\u003C/script>\n\nI became really invested in web accessibility after I realized I could help people with code. I wanted to get past short-lived campaign websites and work on more meaningful projects. In my new job at [Substantial](http://substantial.com \"Link opens in a new window\"), I took advantage of some downtime and did research on [Accessibility and the Shadow DOM](http://substantial.com/blog/2014/02/05/accessibility-and-the-shadow-dom/ \"Link opens in a new window\") because I was curious about it. I initially thought it was such a non-issue that Shadow DOM was accessible that I almost didn't publish anything. But I pressed on since there was very little information about Web Components and accessibility at the time. I didn't know if anyone would listen to me, or if I was stating something obvious. But my research began to be quoted and referenced across the web (and is now in the [Polymer FAQ](https://www.polymer-project.org/resources/faq.html#accessibility \"Link opens in a new window\") on accessibility). \n\nBefore attending CSUN, I was nervous about being an outsider with limited connections to people with disabilities. I was starting to speak at conferences about accessibility. Was I a super-fan, or an impostor? I couldn't just _leave out_ accessibility at work because I cared about designing and building experiences that everyone could use. I thought my heart must be in the right place. I officially learned I'd been saying the right things about accessibility when I heard them echoed by my industry heroes from WebAIM in the first 10 minutes of CSUN. I felt validated and at home. I found my people, actually, and I vowed to fight the good fight for them.\n\nThis year when I began planning my trip to CSUN, I [joked publicly](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/551492284039307265 \"Link opens in a new window\") about biking to the conference, and once again, I felt a mixed bag of emotions. On the one hand, I was overjoyed to present my work with Angular.js accessibility and Material Design on my 31st birthday. On the other, I worried it was insensitive to boast about biking to an accessibility conference with a cake on the front rack. But, it was Pee Wee Herman in Pee Wee's Big Adventure that made me feel I was being too hard on myself about the whole thing. Oddly enough, Pee Wee's love for his bicycle and attitude towards life were a way I could gain perspective (the fun/creative art bits, not the movie theater scandal bits). This is where I sorted things out: if you're passionate about something, like biking or accessibility, you should celebrate it. Do as much of the thing that makes you happy as you can. People will respect that. They may even ride on a tandem bike with you.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative; margin-bottom: 1em;\">\n    \u003Ciframe style=\"position:absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vJXU7EVXs2A?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure - Bike Flip\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\u003C/div>","src/content/posts/riding-a-bicycle-to-an-accessibility-conference/index.mdx",[1218],"./Pee-wee-bike.jpg","b57ec35c2a9eaf7f","salary-and-career-growth/2019-08-21-salary-career-growth",{"id":1220,"data":1222,"body":1226,"filePath":1227,"digest":1228,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1223,"date":1224,"path":1225},"Salary and Career Growth",["Date","2019-08-31T00:00:00.000Z"],"/salary-career-growth","This week I hosted a lunch meetup for [NW Tech Women](https://meetup.com/NW-Tech-Women) in downtown Bellingham, where we had a discussion about building a career in tech and negotiating for a higher salary. There were some valuable insights shared related to local and remote working conditions, and how we could make the most out of our careers. To share those insights broader so more people can benefit, I’ve compiled some notes and published them in this post.\n\n## A new partnership: NW Tech Women and TAG NW\n\nNW Tech Women recently became a community group in partnership with [TAG NW](https://www.tagnw.org/what-we-do/), a local nonprofit organization working to strengthen the tech community in NW Washington state. As part of this effort, I’ve started to reboot their Women in Tech lunch meetings, which had stopped after running for a few years. This week was our first meeting all together, and it felt like a wonderful start with some fresh faces and helpful insights! Thank you to Faithlife for providing a free space for us to meet, and to TAG NW for their ongoing support.\n\n## The first NW Tech Women / WIT Luncheon\n\nWith 12 women in attendance, we went around the room to introduce ourselves and speak about what we’re doing in our careers and where we hoped to grow. Most everyone was working in tech in some capacity, either at a local business or in a remote job, and there was one student looking to network (fantastic!).\n\nIt was an interesting conversation that began with someone whose career as a software developer was coming up on the 2-year mark. They wanted to increase their salary by 10-15%: they’d just switched teams, were growing technically, and were beginning to have a broader understanding of employment in tech.\n\nFor another woman, her experience included moving cities - making adjustments for local regions, looking for remote roles that allowed her to live in Bellingham, etc. There was some talk about where “Hey y’all” would come from in an introduction if the person grew up on the West Coast (with a parent in Texas), and it turned out to be a conscious move away from the word “guys”–which can feel like you’re only addressing the men in the room. \n\nA technical manager at a manufacturing company was working to make their value known on the job at a place where IT wasn’t their core focus. Perhaps surfacing customer email that communicates the value they’ve contributed in their experience?\n\nFor a remote developer working from Bellingham for a Silicon Valley company, they were thinking about upcoming performance reviews. When would be the right time to negotiate a salary? \n\nFor the Senior Director of Customer Success at a local Bellingham software company, she wanted to talk about salary negotiations, including handling it from the employer/hiring perspective. She had taken a lower salary in exchange for a flexible schedule and working from home, which was also indicative of the choices people make to work at local companies when there is sometimes higher-paying work elsewhere (or remote).\n\nSome in attendance wanted to discuss solutions for improving your salary when you’ve been at a company for a while. What are some strategies for doing that?\n\nAnd for someone who’s looking for work as a developer, data scientist, or project manager after time off to be a mom, what do they need to be thinking about to get the most out of the experience?\n\n## Local vs. Regional Job Scope\n\nWe talked about Bellingham salaries, which are typically much lower for local businesses than in Seattle. Depending on the company, they may or may not be competitive in pay based on city or state: something that’s made more difficult without wage transparency. To find out which companies pay local or regional wages, asking someone who works there could be a good strategy. \n\nOne person in an employer role had worked with a consultant who recommended adjusting pay by state instead of city (but they admitted it can’t be the only factor to determining salary). Adjustment of wages can get tricky with a geographical discrepancy, and gender/seniority can come into play in addition to other factors like race or disability. For example, a woman in a lower-paying market could end up making a lot less than a man with the same skills and experience for more than one reason: systemic underpaying of women (especially women of color) in addition to a geographical pay gap.\n\nGovernment jobs have salary transparency by nature - at least salary ranges. The question was posed again, when is the right time to ask about salary? How about benefits and parental leave policy? They felt it was hard to ask those questions without putting your cards on the table about what’s important to you. Another person said if that dance is too delicate, perhaps you don’t want to work there; an interesting thought about the signals we can observe early in our job seeking/interviewing experience.\n\n## Determining your priorities in a job: and asking for them\n\nFor a recent coding bootcamp grad, they got a job at a local company after graduating. The company’s paradigm is to offer an internship and use a 90-day period to decide if something is a good fit, and typically they favor university Computer Science grads over bootcamp grads: but she got in and has worked there for a couple of years now. In getting hired, a full-time role was her priority over something like a higher salary or company characteristics.\n\nIt was observed from an employer that men do ask more for salary increases than women because they’re like, “what do I have to lose?” A male employee had said “I think I should make $1000 more” and they were the only man on a team of 20+ women. She gave them kudos for asking even if they didn’t ask it in the right way, and they saw it as a great coaching opportunity. They also wished that more women would ask for a raise along with conversations about their value and contributions as employees. For us, there’s always a worry about discrimination, even from women employers, so some fear and anxiety comes with asking a lot of the time. A good question to ask and feel out a potential company was proposed: “are there people with families?”\n\nSome companies require women to not take a paycheck during maternity leave in the United States, and pay back their insurance costs for the time they weren’t collecting a paycheck (!!!). Washington State laws are changing - if you live and work in Washington state, a portion of your paycheck now goes to a tax for a parental and family leave fund. To learn more, read about [FMLA coverage](https://www.lni.wa.gov/WorkplaceRights/LeaveBenefits/FamilyCare/LawsPolicies/FamilyLeave/default.asp).\n\n## Negotiating for a salary, including ranges\n\nAt the time of a job offer is smart to ask for more money–especially since the starting salary can set the tone for your tenure. Can you write to someone at the company and get insider information that could help you in the interview process, including a salary range for a given role? Do you have a range for yourself that you need for the job to be worth it?\n\nAs women and people of marginalized genders, it’s important that we project confidence and aim high while finding an appropriate range for our potential contributions. Sometimes it can help to start out by saying “I’ll entertain any reasonable offer” when they ask you for a number. If you then ask for a range for the position, that can help you calibrate your expectations and know where to go next. And remember that benefits, bonuses, commissions, equity, time off, family leave, and more can contribute to the decision depending on your priorities.\n\nOnce you’re established in a company, someone asked how can you negotiate up in salary/title. Someone added that having advocates at the top–especially women–can help. Asking for salary parity with your peers is a good approach. As managers, we should be making sure that we counter systemic pay gaps by paying people well for the work they do no matter their gender, race, disability, or some other protected characteristic.\n\n## Asking for raises and factoring in levels\n\nSomeone asked how you can find out about levels in a company, i.e. “senior” vs. “staff” roles. At any point, creating a portfolio and doing competitive research can help to bring to your company leadership as data to support you getting a raise. You could go to HR and ask about a range ahead of a meeting with your manager - most HR people would be interested in working with you, especially if women aren't asking for raises enough. \n\nIn terms of asking for a raise after doing your homework, ranges and percentages can help! After you ask, let it simmer and don’t jump in too soon–this is often where people sabotage their hard work and lose leverage out of fear. \n\nAt Gatsby we’ve published our [Engineering Level Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11bLD1NcMy6qeJrM_9e56YYiiYrKd9Ae5ozRC1xdMLTE/edit#gid=0) and shared it with those who are [interviewing for roles](https://gatsbyjs.com/careers), which can really help to understand where one would need to grow to make it to the next level as a software engineer. I think more companies should do things like this to more effectively communicate expectations about roles and leveling, huge factors in establishing salaries and raises. (Pay transparency, too! I’ll see what we can do about that. :)\n\n## Communicating your contributions and value\n\nAs an employee, it can help to make your contributions and desire for growth known over the year with your manager: especially in writing, which creates a paper trail. It helps to advocate for yourself and show value you’ve already contributed. Keep good notes about your successes, especially for things in addition to what you were hired for. Advocate for yourself internally if you can so other people see value, too. And ask yourself do you say “we” too often when it was really all you who did the work? It's good to be a team player and uplift your colleagues but keep your own career in mind, too.\n\nMake a habit of collecting data on what you've done to add value to the company. It may help to understand what matters to the person who’s hiring or promoting you regarding company objectives and goals. What do they care about? As managers at Gatsby, we write “headlines of awesome” for product updates including how we’re supporting quarterly goals or initiatives. I proposed people do this for themselves, too. Keep a journal for what you learned each day or week. \n\nIt can also help to document and share the things you’ve learned along the way for less experienced people. For those who need motivation to write regularly, consider having a colleague hold you accountable for deadlines. You could also set up a video chat with a friend to force yourself to do it. Another reason to write? Contributing blog posts on your company’s website can show your value: a hard data point you can use in your next performance review.\n\n## Until next time...\n\nFor the first meetup of our combined groups, this was a fantastic outcome. We’ll continue to have luncheons like this in the future, and I’ll be compiling a list of discussion topics and doing more outreach to diverse groups in our small city. A bigger goal I have for NW Tech Women is to connect members as volunteers to organizations needing technology help, and provide support for design/code review at our meetings. But the social aspect has been the biggest driver for [keeping this group going](/great-leadership-gatsby-and-girl-develop-it#Turning-a-disappointing-outcome-into-better-opportunities), and it’s exciting to see it grow.","src/content/posts/salary-and-career-growth/2019-08-21-salary-career-growth.mdx","e862c41bca89f24d","speak-at-your-local-elementary-school",{"id":1229,"data":1231,"body":1236,"filePath":1237,"assetImports":1238,"digest":1240,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1232,"date":1233,"path":1234,"coverImage":1235},"Speak at your local elementary school.",["Date","2015-05-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"/speak-at-your-local-elementary-school","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./school-talk-standup-desk.jpg","Last summer, a 4th and 5th grade science teacher from rural Oregon emailed me to ask if I would speak to his class over a Google Hangout. The goal was to increase awareness about STEM opportunities for all of his students, but particularly the girls. By introducing them to a female role model, perhaps they would be inspired to pursue careers as computer programmers. (When I was in 7th grade, a photojournalist came to one of my classes. I was so intrigued I got my first college degree in photojournalism.)\n\n![Standing at my desk](./school-talk-standup-desk.jpg)\n\nAt my desk on a Google Hangout (Thanks Jennifer Hayes for the photo)\n\nI spoke with Dylan McCann's class for 30 minutes from my stand-up desk at Substantial. I'd put together a short [slide deck](http://marcysutton.github.io/how-did-i-get-here/#/) to provide visuals with some information about my background, starting with my earliest creative spark: a family newsletter I made with Microsoft Publisher called _Marci's Monthly_ (back when I spelled my name with an _i_). The students came very prepared with questions and we had a great time exchanging ideas.\n\n[![My slide deck, saying \"When I was your age...\"](./when-i-was-your-age.jpg)](http://marcysutton.github.io/how-did-i-get-here/#/ \"Slide deck\")\n\nWhen I was your age...I had a newsletter called Marci's Monthly\n\nI kept in touch with the teacher, Dylan McCann, who is doing a great job educating his students about rewarding career opportunities. I try to make time for things like school talks because of the potential to positively impact even just one student. This weekend, I received the following email from Dylan:\n\n> Marcy,\n> \n> I just wanted to let you know about Tyler. She is a student in my class. I had her as a student last year as well. She has always been a little bit behind in her level and struggled with confidence issues. Ever since your talk earlier this year, I noticed a distinct change in her attitude in class. All of a sudden she started working harder, got excited about learning, wanting to do better all the time. A few months ago I noticed she kept making references to your talk and about how she wants to be a programmer like you. She even helped me do a presentation about STEM to another school district talking about how influential you were to her and how you helped her realize that she could do that as well. I think she really connected with you. You have made a difference in the lives of my students and I really appreciate that.\n\nWow. To hear that I impacted someone's life in such a positive way brought tears to my eyes. It is really worth taking time out of our regular work schedules to give back to those coming after us.

An idea dawned on me: why not make my own iPad recipe app where we can all contribute content? I surveyed the competition (or inspiration), grappled with web-app vs. native, brainstormed on features and came up with a plan. I decided on the web-app route to leverage my existing skill-set and get this thing done in a reasonable amount of time (I only had a month until Christmas at that point).\n\nI refinined the experience to make our family web-app as useful as possible -- I'm the only web developer in the group, so it was important that both the front-end and admin areas be intuitive and easy to use.\n\nVersion 1.0 of Spiceboard includes: (WP = Wordpress-specific)\n\n- Media queries for portrait & landscape layout switching\n- Custom tap-to-display navigation menu\n- Custom fields for ingredients & preparation (WP)\n- Multiple post thumbnails (WP)\n- Apple bookmark icon\n- Email notification when a new recipe is added (WP)\n- Show/hide comments (WP)\n\nOther ideas for the project:\n\n- Custom inline comment plugin similar to Soundcloud that tags a specific part of a recipe (like writing in the margins of a cookbook)\n- Swipe navigation, possibly via integration with Sencha Touch\n- More content!","src/content/posts/spiceboard-for-ipad/index.mdx","7e8134aa84a3eb23","summing-up-jsconf-eu-2014",{"id":1250,"data":1252,"body":1257,"filePath":1258,"assetImports":1259,"digest":1261,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1253,"date":1254,"path":1255,"coverImage":1256},"Summing Up JSConf EU 2014",["Date","2014-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"],"/summing-up-jsconf-eu-2014","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./marcy_jsconf_blog.jpg","_This post was migrated from its original location on the [Substantial](http://substantial.com) blog._\n\nIn 2014 I traveled to Berlin to speak at [JSConf EU](http://2014.jsconf.eu/), a community-run conference for European JavaScript lovers. I'd never been to Berlin before and it was the largest conference so far to accept one of my proposals; I was excited!\n\n## Hello, Berlin\n\n![Bauhaus Archive, Berlin](./marcy_bauhaus_blog.jpg)\n\nBauhaus Archive, Berlin\n\nAfter a couple of days of exploring the city including the [Bauhaus Archive](http://www.bauhaus.de/en/), which is _awesome_, and crashing parties for JSFest Berlin (of which JSConf EU is just a part), it was time to head to Radialsystem V, an arts center in a former pumping station on the Spree River. The opening included impressive visuals on a giant 3D projector and live dance music manipulated with JavaScript ([related reading](https://medium.com/@cramforce/wtf-is-happening-d67a92937584 \"Link opens in a new window\"))—immediately, I felt at home as a lover of both JavaScript and electronic music.\n\n![JSConf EU opening at Radialsystem](./marcy_jsconf_blog.jpg)\n\nJSConf EU 2014 opening at Radialsystem V\n\n## The Talks\n\nHere are some of my favorite talks from the conference:\n\nJake Archibald from Google first spoke about [ServiceWorkers](http://jakearchibald.com/2014/service-worker-first-draft/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), a new API [implemented in Chrome and Firefox Nightly](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/ \"Link opens in a new window\") with potential to \"change the scope of the web more than any feature since XHR.\" ServiceWorkers provide consistent background processing, enabling better performance, push messaging, offline capabilities, and more. Pretty useful, given JavaScript's single-threaded nature. It was cool hearing about such an important feature that could be usable [soon](http://jakearchibald.com/2014/using-serviceworker-today/ \"Link opens in a new window\").\n\nI also enjoyed fellow Seattleite and [CascadiaJS](http://2014.cascadiajs.com/) founder Carter Rabasa's talk on the challenge he had sustaining a full-time job while running a conference, Sports Hack Day and a co-working space in the same year. Carter explained how we need to work closer with people in our communities to help produce the best events we can. By not recognizing that people want to help and taking on too much ourselves, everything suffers. As a co-organizer of Girl Develop It Seattle with a full-time job, this resonated quite a bit with me. I've already begun to lean more on members of the GDI community to make our chapter the best it can be.\n\n![Keep Calm and Code JavaScript mugs](./marcy_jsconfmug_blog.jpg)\n\nJSConf EU mug-swag\n\nAnother of my favorite talks was by Sara Robinson from [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), titled “[What Harry Potter Can Teach Us About JavaScript](https://sarajrobinson.com/jsconfeu/#/ \"Link opens in a new window\").” She talked about internationalization and how to implement it in a client-side project. Just like accessibility and mobile, internationalization is a lot easier when you plan ahead, especially when dealing with something as intricate as Harry Potter (try translating \"Diagon Alley\" into 60 languages!). The talk also highlighted something special about European conferences: a focus on multiple nationalities. I would have appreciated more accessible demos and a note or two about performance implications, but it was a cool talk.\n\nTowards the end of day two, Firefox OS contributor Jan Jongboom gave a great talk titled [\"Abusing Phones To Make the Internet of Things\"](http://www.slideshare.net/janjongboom/jsconf-eu-2014-abusing-phones-to-make-the-internet-of-things \"Link opens in a new window\") where he hacked a doorbell and created a drunk friend tracker with a $25 Firefox phone, which uses HTML5 and JavaScript. His enthusiasm and curiosity for the subject made it really entertaining. And just a week later [GE announced an interface board](http://makezine.com/2014/09/19/ge-launches-an-interface-board-to-let-you-to-hack-their-appliances/ \"Link opens in a new window\") you can use to hack your home appliances using Node.js. The future is cool!\n\nI also loved the talks by Brad Bouse, Raquel Velez, Jenna Zeiger, Jan Monschke, and Glen Maddern. I appreciated the wonderfully interesting things people had to say and how they delivered them. I'm excited to see what I missed when the [JSConf EU videos](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SmZ9XcTpMS4\"Link opens in a new window\") roll out any day now.\n\n### My Talk\n\n![JavaScript for Everybody title slide](./marcy_titleslide_blog.jpg)\n\nJavaScript for Everybody title slide\n\nFor my European conference debut, I gave a talk titled “JavaScript for Everybody: Accessibility of JavaScript MVCs”, an evolved version of [a talk I gave at CascadiaJS](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/50o_Ig3lk08\"Link opens in a new window\"). This time, I delivered it wearing gold pants and sparkles, _because Berlin_. (It was also a device to message accessibility in a less serious way, starting with my own attitude.) The day before the talk, social media buzzed once again about the inaccessibility of VirginAmerica.com, an Angular.js site I've criticized in the past. So, I recorded a new video in my hotel room demoing the site and added it to the talk. When the time came to get up on stage, my nerves were at a minimum, my mind was clear and I got to say everything I wanted to say, including: accessibility is about people; how to understand and utilize ARIA; what to look for in a JavaScript framework; and, how I've made an impact with accessibility on Angular.js Material Design. The demo gods shined that day, as I was able to show off an accessible dance button that played an animated gif with music using Glen Maddern's [x-gif Web Component](http://geelen.github.io/x-gif/ \"Link opens in a new window\"). I also played a video clip from the inspiration for the gold pants: the German Sparkle Party (they were also paying homage to [Tom Dale and his gold shorts](https://twitter.com/tomdale/status/400980144329728000 \"Link opens in a new window\")). It went swimmingly, [even without tacos](http://substantial.com/blog/2014/06/19/evolution-of-a-jsconf-talk/)!\n\nFor me, a big reason to work hard and travel across the globe for a 30 minute talk is to increase awareness of accessibility amongst people who can make a difference in their daily work. At JSConf EU, it felt successful when people told me things like, \"this is what I needed to finally start addressing accessibility\" and \"I’d never thought of that before.\" I was especially flattered seeing tweets from influential people like Remy Sharp and Raquel Velez:\n\n> “Partly inspired during [@marcysutton](https://twitter.com/marcysutton \"Link opens in a new window\")’s [#jsconfeu](https://twitter.com/hashtag/jsconfeu?src=hash \"Link opens in a new window\") talk and [@karlgroves](https://twitter.com/karlgroves \"Link opens in a new window\")’ recent open issues, I’ve landed a few aria related fixes to [@js\\_bin](https://twitter.com/js_bin \"Link opens in a new window\").” [@rem](https://twitter.com/rem/status/511087606231474176 \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\n> “Accessibility is about \\*people\\* - not thinking about it, and using frameworks that don’t care about it, is irresponsible.” [@rockbot](https://twitter.com/rockbot/status/511080147748143104 \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\n## The Parties\n\n![Ricoloop at JSConf EU](./marcy_ricoloop_blog.jpg)\n\nRicoloop at JSConf EU\n\nI attended parties for RejectJS and CSSConf EU, which were both lovely. But JSConf EU had two parties that were really freaking cool. [Saturday night](http://2014.jsconf.eu/news/2014/09/01/saturday-night-party.html \"Link opens in a new window\") at the conference venue, Tim Pietrusky presented \"Nerd Disco,\" and talked about how he’d been inspired by Deadmau5 and started hacking LEDs timed to music. It seemed like a pretty young project, but his excitement was obvious. After Nerd Disco, an artist named Ricoloop got up and did a live set as one-man electronic band. It was awesomely Berlin. Dan Webb from Twitter also got up and played some gritty UK beats, which I loved. We had the whole dance floor to ourselves by that point.\n\nSunday night, JSConf EU held a party on a boat, the Hoppetosse. Some friends and I walked there after dinner and I got to say most of my goodbyes as I was leaving the next day. (I'm so happy to have made friends in the JavaScript community—conferences have made that possible.) On the way out, I heard an old house song I hadn't heard since going to underground parties back in high school in Seattle. It took some searching, but I found the track: [Pepe Bradock, Deep Burnt](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/opvopULDhVI \"Link opens in a new window\"). It will always remind me of the wonderful time I had in Berlin.","src/content/posts/summing-up-jsconf-eu-2014/index.mdx",[1260],"./marcy_jsconf_blog.jpg","bdf3898de6d7fbac","sutton-rv",{"id":1262,"data":1264,"body":1268,"filePath":1269,"digest":1270,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1265,"date":1266,"path":1267},"Sutton RV",["Date","2010-08-29T00:00:00.000Z"],"/sutton-rv","In 2008 I redesigned and built my Dad's RV dealership website, [SuttonRV.com](http://suttonrv.com/).

Because other firms were creating print and online ads, I also created a downloadable brand guide for vendors in order to promote a consistent identity.\n\nSee how the design evolved:\n\n![Sutton RV - old design](./oldsite-207x300.jpg \"Sutton RV - Old Site Design\")\n\n![Sutton RV - new design](./newsite-223x300.jpg \"Sutton RV - New Site Design\")\n\nSome successes of the project included successful brand communication and a sophisticated user-interface for the RV industry.

This project was special because I got to lead front-end development on a redesign for an amazing brand and write modern code that's both responsive & accessible. We also truly had the dream team for a while at POP Agency, showing that harmonious teams produce great work together. In the end, we won Target's Best of the Bullseye Award for innovation for delivering a fresh, functional website our clients loved.\n\n![Target's Best of the Bullseye Award for Innovation](./2013-05-16_1368722163.jpg)\n\nTarget's Best of the Bullseye Award for Innovation\n\n> Note: The site has now been replaced by A Bullseye View, which I worked on for a very short time...but it is still nice to be able to revisit the site on the [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20130728214237/https://corporate.target.com/).\n\n## Accessible, Responsive UI Patterns\n\nIn 2012, responsive web design was just getting started. On this project, I got to work with brilliant designers and the rich Target brand to bring a gorgeous corporate website to life. To shorten the feedback loops between design and development, I got the opportunity to prototype accessible, responsive UI patterns alongside the design team before implementing on the real site with a CMS.\n\nThe most notable patterns that we iterated upon before finally implementing included a mobile-friendly and accessible megamenu, and flipping cards on the Target Corporate homepage. I really loved experimenting with those patterns and making sure they were keyboard and screen reader accessible, as well as responsive to various breakpoints.\n\n## Media Queries: Breakpoints Based on Content\n\nFor this redesign, there were three sets of comps for the major breakpoints: mobile portrait, tablet portrait and desktop. This kept costs down since it takes time to update every wireframe & comp with client feedback and revisions (holy workload!). Fine, but this required me to make some decisions during the development process: in setting only three breakpoints, I had to account for all of the in-between sizes and orientations beyond what was committed to pixels and shown to the client (this is why developers with an eye for design are so useful).\n\nSome of the specific media queries I used:\n\n```\n\n/* Tablet Portrait */\n@media only screen and (min-device-width:1024px) and (max-width:989px),\n       screen and (min-device-width:320px) and (max-device-width:1024px) {\n   // tablet-specific styles here\n}\n/* Smartphone Portrait */\n@media only screen and (min-device-width:320px) and (max-width:688px),\n       screen and (max-device-width:688px) and (orientation:portrait) {\n   // phone styles here\n}\n/* Smartphone Landscape */\n@media only screen and (max-width:688px) and (orientation:landscape) {\n   // more awesome phone styles here\n}\n\n```\n\nDuring this process I learned the value of designing & developing for mobile first (or content first, even). After a prototype phase focused on responsive navigation, I built the remainder of the chrome for desktop, tablets and phones. The tablet media queries became applicable when scaling to 989 pixels wide—arbitrary, but it worked well across various tablets. Mobile was the environment where screen width and content had to become BFFs: when the main navigation would no longer fit in one row, the whole thing had to collapse into a single menu button (the \"hamburger icon\") via media queries and JS. This meant that smaller tablets like the Kindle Fire got the mobile layout in portrait mode since they aren't wide enough for the main navigation to fit in a single row. My colleague and I put a lot of effort into making the browser scale up and down fluidly....I call this going after the nerd vote. In modern browsers, drag the screen around and watch it move. Ooooooh, ahhhh. If only all projects had that much time & budget.\n\n## Symbol Fonts for Special Characters\n\n@font-face is awesome. No more cufon, sIFR or settling for Verdana on every website. There are performance implications to replacing all the text on your website but support has come far enough that you can easily use custom fonts in your projects. I prefer to restrict it to headlines but that's just me: I like a snappy-loading site (yet admittedly I have room for improvement around responsive images). Custom fonts aren't just for body copy, however: symbol fonts are totally useful & scalable. Hello, vector icons! Mobile menu & search icons? Sweet!\n\nHow do you use a symbol font? You load it with @font-face and type the corresponding character in your markup that gets replaced by the font. This means there are random ô and X characters being indexed and read aloud, however. Solution: specify the character as content in CSS before: and after: pseudo-elements since they are used for display only and not read aloud in screen readers. (Actually, this is no longer true. For more info, read this post on [Bulletproof Accessible Icon Fonts](http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/bulletproof_icon_fonts.html \"Link opens in a new window\").)\n\nHere is a CSS code example:\n\n```\n\n/* make the symbol font the default */\n    div#menuBtn a {\n        color: #fff;\n        font-family: 'EntypoRegular';\n        display: block;\n        font-size: 54px;\n        text-decoration: none;\n    }\n/* put character in :before pseudo-element */\n    div#menuBtn a:before {\n        content:'i';\n        display:block;\n    }\n/* class set by JS changes display of icon to X (close) */\n    div#menuBtn.active a {\n        font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n        font-size:24px;\n        height:29px;\n        padding-top:5px;\n    }\n    div#menuBtn.active a:before {\n        content:'X';\n    }\n\n```\n\nMy favorite fonts: [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\") and [Symbolset](http://symbolset.com/ \"Link opens in a new window\"). There are heaps of others. You could also roll your own if you know how to make fonts!\n\nAlso note: only Droid fonts come installed on Android phones—even Helvetica would require @font-face. My solution? Just don't tell the Design team!\n\n## Modernizr & Progressive Enhancement\n\nI got to use all the fancy CSS3 and HTML5 I wanted and let IE users get a less-awesome experience since they're using a crappy browser. I set expectations with the client and QA regarding a progressive enhancement policy so they would know that IE8 can't have rounded corners or box shadows. Of course, if rounded corners were the cornerstone of the design and the client used IE8, I would have had to find a way to support them. Modernizr won't solve your problems but it will help you detect feature support in order to provide fallbacks.\n\n## Responsive / Mobile Tools Save the Day\n\nThe RWD Responsive Design Bookmarklet by Victor Coulon is extremely useful (though you still need to check on an actual device): [RWD Bookmarklet for Chrome](http://responsive.victorcoulon.fr/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nYou know what else is totally awesome? iOS6's Web Inspector in Safari. Plug in a device to your Mac and open Safari...you can use the console and element inspector just like on your desktop browser!\n\nI also experimented with Adobe Edge Inspect (formerly Shadow) but I had a tough time making it work on an internal network. Most recently I couldn't get any console log statements from a device connected in this way and ditched it. But you may find some value in it.\n\n## Internet buzz\n\n[@RWD shoutout](https://twitter.com/RWD/status/253584501584842753 \"Link opens in a new window\")  \n[Responsivator](http://dfcb.github.com/Responsivator/?site=http://corporate.target.com \"Link opens in a new window\") (now defunct)","src/content/posts/target-corporate-website/index.mdx",[1281],"./corp-site-responsive.jpg","5ccf8fd45a1ed497","the-deal-with-developer-advocacy",{"id":1283,"data":1285,"body":1290,"filePath":1291,"assetImports":1292,"digest":1294,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1286,"date":1287,"path":1288,"coverImage":1289},"The Deal with Developer Advocacy",["Date","2018-11-20T00:00:00.000Z"],"/the-deal-with-developer-advocacy","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./mr-rogers-quote.png","![When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, \"Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.” ― Fred Rogers](./mr-rogers-quote.png)\n\nAs a Developer Advocate, I often think about what impact I want to have and the best ways to accomplish that goal. My job is to meet developers where they’re at and inspire them to make more accessible websites and applications for people with disabilities; hopefully using [our tools](https://www.deque.com/tools/ \"Link opens in a new window\"), but success to me does not hinge on that.\n\nSometimes developers don’t code with accessibility in mind because they don’t know about it yet, and given new information they’ll make a change; other times they don’t care to prioritize it or don’t feel it applies to them (“we’ll do it later”, “that’s not our audience”, etc.). Regardless, I seek to motivate and persuade developers across the industry to make an impact with accessibility; a worthy goal, but sometimes it isn’t easy.\n\nI’ve written in the past about the tension between [_being patient and being loud_](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/marcy-sutton/2015-april-20 \"Link opens in a new window\"), particularly in accessibility: do you wait for something to be fixed over time, or make waves in an effort to improve things? I observed back in 2015 that people don’t appreciate negativity and scolding when they aren’t doing things exactly as you’d like or expect, which is still true. I’ll admit I haven’t always been a perfect exemplar of this, as I’m also a human being who feels frustration and angst when I see people with disabilities being cast aside. As advocates, we’re supposed to avoid criticizing in the name of feel-good PR. But how do you make lasting change when people aren’t acting in good faith?\n\nOver time I’ve realized that my job title is occasionally in conflict with my own values: I am a Developer Advocate, but I’m also an _accessibility advocate_ at heart. In trying to make the world better for people with disabilities as a temporarily able-bodied person, it seems right to use my privilege and amplify their voices (e.g. “I’m Deaf and there are little-to-no captions here”, or “I’m blind and this update will jeopardize my livelihood”). When accessibility is ignored or demoted in favor of shipping, how could I possibly look the other way? Would sugarcoating it and using the nicest possible tone really make a difference where patterns of discrimination are concerned? Is the fact that I'm a woman speaking up about something playing into this at all?\n\nOutside of the niche accessibility market, I’ve noticed that Developer Advocates can sometimes get a little carried away with their cause, pushing away the very people they’re trying to reach. Whether it’s web performance, standards, frameworks or something else, at some point railroading people with your opinions can start to hurt your cause more than it helps.\n\nI can obviously see direct parallels to accessibility advocacy: except I’m fighting for users’ civil rights to access more than a subjective approach to programming. I do think there is value in being realistic about what people with disabilities face, given it is done with respect and without \"gaining points\" as able-bodied people. I can see a distinction between fact-based criticism and subjective opinions. But that only goes so far; being aggressive and neglecting to persuade may backfire. To paraphrase Maya Angelou: \"people won't remember what you said; they'll remember how you made them feel.\" By bringing people along rather than scolding, there's a higher likelihood they'll join you.\n\nWhere I’ve landed with all of these swirling ideas is this: by speaking up about something, are you helping or hurting your cause? In the spirit of Mr. Rogers, we should always aim to be the helpers. Except that's a bit of a trick question: due to power dynamics, helping one group may come at the perceived inconvenience of a more powerful, oppressive group. It is sometimes impossible to please everyone at the same time, no matter how happy of a spin you put on it. But we should still try to lift everyone up rather than shaming; that's optimism.\n\nThis is something I’m continually working on as I strive to make the web more accessible, and I'm grateful to those who contribute helpful, measured perspectives in an attempt to understand and resolve conflicts.\n\nI wrote this post mainly because I’ve had some serious unpacking of feelings to do after difficult but meaningful conversations on social media in the past week. I'll let them drift off into space and not link to them here, so I can focus more on that unabashed optimism. But hopefully what I’ve written can help you in some way.

Perhaps you gave a conference talk and one or two negative comments ate away at you, making it difficult to socialize. Or maybe someone assumed you were a developer’s spouse, or in another profession entirely, before you were assumed to be a developer.\n\nEven as we are our own worst critics, other peoples’ comments can set doubt into motion. How can we break away from paralyzing sources of doubt and get back to our most brilliant and badass selves? Can you make yourself feel more confident even though you feel the opposite of that and want to run for the hills? This post explores how we can build ourselves up to endure (and hopefully enjoy) social situations in the technology field and beyond.\n\n## Act like you’re supposed to be there.\n\nI’ve often heard the phrase “it’s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission”, attributed to the [celebrated computer programmer Grace Hopper](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper). I may have taken that advice a bit too far, but I once crashed a giant, lavish party with a friend at a public park. We acted like we were supposed to be there, even though we clearly weren’t, and gained entry to the outdoor event of the decade. Now, I’m definitely not telling you to go party crashing; however, as I became an adult, I saw tangible value in showing up and acting confident. When paired with social awareness, I saw doors open as I navigated situations. (I fully admit to having some privilege here, as well.)\n\nFast forward a few years to working as a web developer in a male-dominated industry. At times, I was the only female dev on of a team of 25; it was common to feel outnumbered. I wanted to get into public speaking, and local meetups were a place to get started–they were also completely full of men. I remember overcoming nerves when giving my first talk on Accessible JavaScript at \"Super Seattle JS\", an event for speakers rejected from the CascadiaJS conference. I pushed any feelings of doubt completely out of my mind and tried to bring forward the strongest version of myself. I made some rookie mistakes but I survived–and learned that I could absolutely get up and give a talk in front of hundreds of people. I was supposed to be there.\n\n## Be yourself.\n\nI’ve [heard women say](https://medium.com/@sailorhg/coding-like-a-girl-595b90791cce#.n7zjiids9) they dress down to fit in at meetups or conferences, so other developers will take them seriously. I say forget all that! Celebrate your personal style and wear whatever makes you feel most comfortable. If your style is t-shirts and hoodies, rock a t-shirt and a hoodie. If you sometimes like wearing dresses or skirts, own it and wear them with pride.\n\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">@marcysutton\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/KatieK2\">@KatieK2\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/helenvholmes\">@helenvholmes\u003C/a> I started giving all my talks in heels because: A) Stage confidence B) This is what a dev looks like\u003C/p>— Una Kravets (@Una) \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Una/status/671403745557749760\">November 30, 2015\u003C/a>\u003C/blockquote>\n\nAs I did more public speaking, my fear of being outnumbered subsided and confidence grew. I started showing up to tech events with the same unabashed confidence I had as a party crasher. While this might not reflect everyone’s personal style, I gave talks in dresses, shiny leggings, and sparkly jackets simply because I love dressing up; speaking was an excuse to do that. When I’m attending an event and not giving a talk, I never choose my attire out of a place of fear. You shouldn’t either, and I’ll tell you why.\n\nClothing can be used as a device to engineer your mood. Have you ever put on a pair of pants that were too small and you felt terrible? (Hi, I have.) Ever put on your favorite outfit and felt fabulous? Get comfortable so you’re feeling good when you present yourself at an event–your presence will more influential than your attire. You’ll show others that “this is what a developer looks like” as your authentic self, whatever that may be.\n\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Person sat in front of me at \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/jsconfeu?src=hash\">#jsconfeu\u003C/a> has matching streaks in their hair and golden leggings, epic look.\u003C/p>— Rob Ashton (@RobAshton) \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/RobAshton/status/511060979137126400\">September 14, 2014\u003C/a>\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cscript async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\">\u003C/script>\n\n## Do a power pose.\n\n“Showing up and acting confident” is easier said than done, I know. As I started writing this post, I thought a lot about people who are more introverted. I’ve also learned personally that extroverts can become introverted under stress: after rough talk feedback, I tend to disappear for alone-time. When I was feeling particularly down after a talk recently, I got some great advice to “do a power pose.” Essentially, trick your mind into feeling more confident by inhabiting a fierce body. Put your arms on your hips like Superwoman and physically feel more powerful.\n\nThis advice comes from a great [Ted talk by Amy Cuddy](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en) a few years ago titled, “Your Body Language Shapes Who you Are”, where she discussed the importance of nonverbal communication in social power dynamics. Her scientific research showed that as little as two minutes spent in a “power pose” can raise testosterone, the hormone affecting confidence, and lower the stress hormone, cortisol. This impacts how others perceive us in all matters of life, from job interviews to conference talks to product pitches. So do yourself a favor and do some power poses if you’re in need of a confidence boost.\n\n## TLDR;\n\nBy harnessing our power within, we can impact how others perceive us. But sometimes we need encouragement to show our most confident selves. To feel powerful before a challenging situation, do a power-pose: find your inner strength by “faking it until you become it.” Take pride in your personal style and dress however you feel most confident, not how you think others expect you to be.

You have to say something to address the loss, and in a way it's healing to talk about it. You also memorialize them with words and pictures: Wally will last forever in my life, whether or not he's around to see it.\n\nThis week I took my 7-year-old dog into the vet as he had swollen lymph nodes and poor appetite. He has had trouble cooling down and breathing in the last few weeks, and now we know why: Wally is suffering from lymphosarcoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes that has taken over his body, including his chest. We didn't notice his lymph nodes were that bad until he got a haircut last Sunday. He has lost weight from not eating because of the amount of energy it takes to eat.\n\nI feel terrible I didn't notice his condition sooner, especially after pushing him on a hot, strenuous hike two weeks ago. But if he had to leave us, at least we spent his last weeks together just like normal: enjoying the summer with more time than usual since I took a month off in between jobs.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"flex-row\">\n\n    ![Laying on the couch](./2012-04-14.jpg)\n    ![Friday night buddy wash](./2012-05-12.jpg)\n    ![Couch snuggles](./2012-02-24.jpg)\n\n\u003C/div>\n\nI keep trying to remind myself, _he's just a dog._ And dogs die. This is life. People lose those closest to them all the time, and they manage. So that's what I'll do. But I'll always remember the dog who transitioned with me into adulthood, who was there through all the relationships and the snow days and the bike rides and hikes. He loved climbing trees and laying in the muddiest of puddles. He would spoon with me on the couch when I was hungover on Saturday, and force me to go play on Sunday. I finally got to take him to the office at Substantial for two years, and he loved it. He got the zoomies in the office one time and everyone stood up, going, \"what is he doing??\"\n\nI got teased for taking \"too many selfies\" with him, and I don't care. If it's foolish to love a dog this much, then I'm fine with being a fool. He taught me about unconditional love and that it's okay to be vulnerable. I'd do it all over again the exact same way.\n\nWally is Mr. Personality, the dog that people said \"could have been in the movies\" with his beard and eyebrows and his tuxedo. I never got tired of saying what kind of dog he is, because everyone wanted to know; he's Border Collie and German Wirehaired Pointer, and I love him. I fought to keep him years ago, and it wasn't my finest moment. But I feel lucky I got to spend 6 years and 4 months with my superboy, my Wally.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"flex-row\">\n\n    ![Hiking at Mailbox Peak](./2012-07-08.jpg)\n    ![Playing frisbee](./2012-04-10.jpg)\n    ![Get the tree!!](./2012-06-17.jpg)\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n![Wally on the Alpine Lakes Wilderness ](./wally-pct2.jpg)","src/content/posts/wallys-last-day/index.mdx",[1317],"./wally-pct2.jpg","89da70c49f9a7fa7","webstock-nz-2013",{"id":1319,"data":1321,"body":1325,"filePath":1326,"digest":1327,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1322,"date":1323,"path":1324},"Webstock & NZ 2013",["Date","2013-03-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"/webstock-nz-2013","On a Saturday morning in December 2012, I was at home reading Twitter when I came across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/kissane/status/277478603816587265 \"Link opens in a new window\") from @Kissane about how fondly she remembered [Webstock](http://www.webstock.org.nz/13/ \"Link opens in a new window\"). I had never heard of the annual conference before but when I looked at the website, I knew immediately that it looked very special (and was fast approaching in February). My mind started racing and I decided right then-and-there that I was going. With butterflies in my stomach, I asked my boss Dave at POP if he would support the conference registration and guess what: HE DID! My mom booked airfare with air miles and the next thing I knew, I was going to Webstock!\n\n## Hello, Wellington!\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"flex-row\">\n\n[![Day One in Welly](./2013-02-13_1360742943.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/VqfbmtSXpA/ \"Day One in Welly: Link opens in a new window\")[![Webstock swag](./2013-02-13_1360781952.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/Vrp1YwSXvz/ \"Webstock swag: Link opens in a new window\")[![Chris Coyier at Webstock](./2013-02-14_1360805007.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/VsVzzWyXh4/ \"Chris Coyier at Webstock: Link opens in a new window\")\n\n\u003C/div>\n\nSometimes you just have to align yourself with where you want to be by showing up and acting like you're supposed to be there (because you ARE supposed to be there). On the morning of day one of Webstock, I accidentally sat at a speaker's table and started talking with Chris Coyier and Jeremy Ashkenas, happily telling them about some of the accessibility stuff I've learned from working on the Target account. I was pretty embarrassed once I discovered what I'd done but I ended up having great conversations with two of my web development idols. I got to talk with quite a few of the speakers and met tons of wonderful people as the conference went on. When folks repeatedly asked me if I was speaking because I came all the way from Seattle, I realized that I do want to start speaking at conferences (and I'm working on my first proposal on JS & Accessibility). I have Webstock to thank for that great opportunity and boost in confidence.\n\nMy slides & notes from presenting on Webstock back home at POP:  \n[Image Slides](/stuff/MarcySutton-Webstock.pdf \"Link opens in a new window\") (PDF, 3.5MB)  \n[Conference Notes](/stuff/MarcySutton-Webstock-2013.txt \"Link opens in a new window\") (TXT, 24kb)\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"flex-row\">\n\n[![The Webstock API by Garage Project](./2013-02-14_1360809470.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/VseUlXSXtg/ \"The Webstock API: Link opens in a new window\")[![Street art in Welly](./2013-02-15_1360969574.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/VxPskeyXly/ \"Street art in Wellington: Link opens in a new window\")[![Mountain biking at Makara Peak](./2013-02-17_1361076283.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/V0bOehSXhR/ \"Mountain biking at Makara Peak: Link opens in a new window\")\n\u003C/div>\n\nI don't think the conference could have been any more successful. I met speakers & peers from around the world, heard amazing talks, got crazy excited about my craft and felt myself grow as an individual. The swag was pretty kickass, too.\n\nTo top it all off, after two days of Webstock I picked up a rental car, went mountain biking at Makara Peak in Wellington and then hopped on a ferry to the South Island where I explored for nearly two weeks all by myself. I hiked, ate, drank, mountain biked, photographed, danced and explored. I picked up hitchhikers (safely) and talked with people I met in hostels. [I met up with Jeremy Ashkenas](http://ashkenas.com/day-42-flock-hill/ \"Link opens in a new window\") at a mountain bike race where he rode proper trails for the first time and then we hiked in the most amazing spot at Arthur's Pass. Though I wished my boyfriend Erik could have joined me, I never really felt lonesome because there was always something magnificent to do. My legs were practically falling off by the end of it–what an adventure! Hopefully I'll make it back to NZ for Webstock again in the future...it is a dream of mine to go back and speak there some day. But I definitely maximized my time spent there, returning home fulfilled, refreshed and excited.\n\n» [More photos on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/59136411@N04/sets/72157632782630459/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"flex-row\">\n\n[![Mt.

The goal of Material Design is to create a cohesive design language across mobile and web platforms, focused on _material_ as a metaphor. Angular Material provides a set of UI components and layout attributes in the Material Design style for use in Angular applications. In this post, I’ll detail some of the things I learned working on such a high-profile, open source framework.\n\nThe biggest thing that took getting used to was the sheer volume of activity on [Github](https://github.com/angular/material). As of this writing, Angular Material (part of the Angular organization) has 760 repository watches, 8600+ stars, 1300+ forks, and 1800+ issues closed in a year. As a team, we closed 368 issues in over 5 weeks in the 0.9 milestone alone. There is also a [Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ngmaterial) with 400+ discussions and undoubtedly additional questions on Stack Overflow and Gitter.\n\nWith such an active community, there are many developers battle-testing the framework and providing feedback. For our team to communicate effectively, it requires patience, compassion and a deep understanding of the codebase and backlog. I quickly learned to request more details in Github issues to better frame the question, including things like:\n\n- Can you provide a Codepen, JSBin or Plunker showing the issue so we can better help you debug?\n- Which browser and platform?\n- What are the steps to reproduce the problem?\n- Can you ask questions in the forum? Github is reserved for bugs or feature requests.\n\nMembers of the community have generally been respectful of our time and they provide more details when requested. We look into every issue, no matter how big or small, which can be daunting: sometimes it feels like “death by a thousand Github Issues”. Angular Material has a few superstar contributors who help answer community questions and request more details, which is appreciated.\n\nWhen triaging so many Github issues, it helps to prioritize them into upcoming milestones or file into the backlog, and chip away little by little. It’s a balancing act when it comes to simultaneously writing features and fixing bugs–too little of either can impact project quality and momentum. On Angular Material, we’ve found a good cadence alternating between feature milestones and bug fixing ones, but it’s impossible to please everyone at all times. We work hard to release well-factored and well-tested code on regular release cycles, moving toward a 1.0 release later this summer.\n\n## New development know-how\n\nI have learned many things since becoming a framework developer, it’s astounding to think back to the _before-time_ when I didn’t know about squashing Git commits or keeping a clean changelog. I was unaware of how global CSS styles could impact consumers of a framework, from text-rendering to typography defaults.\n\nI had to figure out the development environment and what goes where for components and the documentation website: the former is packaged with the library, and the latter is not, but the distinction is not always obvious. Substantial developers Matt Findley and Adam Pearson both helped out on the project, and their contributions improved the Angular Material docs website.\n\nIn UI component architectures, I saw, first-hand, a balancing act of complexity. HTML APIs intentionally kept simple to ease the load on developers have to be _transcluded_ (Angular term) into something more accessible, which ends up being way more complex under the hood. It also obfuscates what we really have to do for accessibility, which, in my opinion, has a negative impact on developer education. Despite the complexity, I’m proud of the progress we’ve made on this framework.\n\n### A note about testing\n\nOne of the biggest skills I gained on this project was integrating accessibility unit tests throughout the codebase. It propelled my work on [ngAria](http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2014/11/using-ngaria.html), Angular’s accessibility module that we include as part of Angular Material, as well as an [accessibility plugin](/angular-protractor-accessibility-plugin/) I wrote for Protractor, the end-to-end testing framework. I learned how to write tests that ensure accessibility features added to a project won’t be unknowingly broken by other contributors. This is a knowledge area I will continue to grow throughout my entire career.\n\n## What this means for accessibility\n\nAlthough it’s challenging to support every device and design scenario with a single UI framework–and there are infinite configurations–I am proud that Angular Material has prioritized accessibility support in components and the docs website.\n\nThe framework enforces labels for switches, radio buttons, icons and more: this ensures components will have adequate text alternatives for screen readers and other assistive technologies. We also use ARIA to fill the gap where custom HTML elements don’t have semantic meaning by themselves. Complex accessibility patterns such as chips, autocomplete and select were difficult to get right the first time, and they may still need some work. But keyboard and screen reader support already in the library means that accessibility will trickle down to every person building a website with Angular Material. As a developer focused on accessibility, this makes my job so worthwhile: adding it to a framework instead of a single website means I can have much a bigger impact.\n\nStepping back, a high-profile project like Angular saying that accessibility is important has made waves in the front-end developer community. Since [presenting at ngEurope](http://substantial.com/blog/2014/11/07/marcy-sutton-ng-europe-2014-on-angularjs-accessibility/) last October, I’ve seen technical conversations start to include accessibility more often. Doors have opened to other mainstream conferences like Fluent and JSConf, and development blog posts promote accessibility instead of anti-patterns (not all the time, but it’s getting better). With Angular 2 including accessibility from the start, I look forward to seeing developer education improve as time goes on. I’m optimistic that with the right role models and messaging, it can only get better.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nSince it’s my last week at Substantial, this is sort-of a bittersweet blog post to write. I got to spend time growing my skillset here, including monumental gains in Git and software testing. I also did some cutting-edge research on [Shadow DOM accessibility](/accessibility-and-the-shadow-dom/), which ended up being a bigger topic than I realized at the time. I’m grateful to my fellow Substantialites for the time and support I’ve had here in the past 2 years.","src/content/posts/what-ive-learned-working-on-a-large-open-source-framework/index.mdx",[1338],"./angular_material.png","e9c9e947ebe28861","whats-your-legacy",{"id":1340,"data":1342,"body":1346,"filePath":1347,"assetImports":1348,"digest":1349,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1343,"date":1344,"path":1345,"coverImage":1313},"What's Your Legacy?",["Date","2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z"],"/whats-your-legacy","_This post originally appeared on [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/marcy-sutton/2015-august-26) on August 26, 2015._\n\n![Wally on the Pacific Crest Trail](./wally-pct2.jpg)\n\nRest-in-peace Wally, my beloved dog, seen here pulling me up a mountain trail in Washington State this summer.\n\nHow will people remember you when you’re gone? Will they say, “she contributed a lot”, or “he was a nice man”, or “she was a helpful mentor”? Increasingly, I feel, it’s how people describe you when you’re not around that means the most.\n\nI remember being inspired as a kid by a female photojournalist from a local newspaper who came to my class. Every time I interact with a kid these days (I don’t have any of my own, yet), I think about how their experiences send them off in different directions...like my niece going to circus camp, or a high schooler attending [Girls Who Code](http://girlswhocode.com/) for the summer. As little as 30 minutes of your time spent with someone could dramatically impact their future. That we can inspire the next generation fills me with hope, lifting us above election seasons, wildfires, income inequality, gun violence and rampant misogyny.\n\n## Who inspires you, and why?\n\nThis summer, I spoke at a software development conference in Amsterdam and took my own bike, making a vacation out of it (I’m a bike nerd). At the speakers’ canal cruise around Amsterdam, I became acquainted with one of the keynote speakers, Mary Shaw, from Pittsburgh, PA. We discovered nearly identical plans to ride our bikes in Belgium later in the week. Not familiar with Mary’s work at Carnegie Melon University before meeting her in person, I was floored to find out I’d spent time with a recipient of the [National Medal for Science and Technology](http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2014/october/october3_shawwinsnationalmedal.html), presented by President Obama, for her research on software architecture.\n\nIt’s not often that I feel starstruck…but I was so honored to speak at the same conference as Mary Shaw. She even came to my talk on Accessibility in Angular! It meant a lot to have her there, no matter how I performed. The next day, I saw Mary’s keynote, _Progress toward an Engineering Discipline of Software_. I loved her meta look at engineering–a job title growing in popularity in software–comparing it to arch and bridge design, from craft to industry. Definitions taken from civil engineering provided a lens for comparison with engineering of software:\n\n**“Creating cost-effective solutions...to practical problems...by applying scientific knowledge…building things...in the service of mankind.\"**\n\nReturning home after the trip to a new job and title, Accessibility Engineer at Adobe, I wondered how my work stacked up against those definitions. After her talk, I got to ask Mary’s take on it directly: she recalled, “building things in the service of mankind” and it was pretty clear that yes, engineering applies to accessibility.\n\nThe day after the conference, my travel partner and I sat drinking tiny cups of espresso with our bikes and backpacks on the platform at Amsterdam’s Centraal Station. And who did we happen to see? Mary Shaw and her partner, Roy, with their tandem bike packed in two suitcases, lining up for the fast train to Belgium. Despite feeling starstruck, I felt compelled to tell Mary and Roy about an experience I’d had speaking to an elementary school science class.\n\n![Me and Mary Shaw on the platform at Amsterdam Centraal](./marcy-maryshaw.jpg)\n\nMe and Mary Shaw on a rail platform at Amsterdam Centraal\n\n## Make time for those coming after you; you might inspire someone.\n\nLast summer, I was invited to speak to a 4th and 5th grade science class in rural Oregon via Google Hangouts. I prepared a [small slide deck](https://marcysutton.github.io/how-did-i-get-here/#/) and spent 30 minutes explaining how I got to that place in my career. The kids came prepared some great questions; I talked with them how I would with my 8-year-old niece and 11-year-old nephew. It was a fun experience and the class seemed to enjoy it, even if they looked ready to run outside for recess. A few months later, I got an email from the teacher:\n\n> Marcy,\n> \n> I just wanted to let you know about Tyler. She is a student in my class. I had her as a student last year as well. She has always been a little bit behind in her level and struggled with confidence issues. Ever since your talk earlier this year, I noticed a distinct change in her attitude in class. All of a sudden she started working harder, got excited about learning, wanting to do better all the time. A few months ago I noticed she kept making references to your talk and about how she wants to be a programmer like you. She even helped me do a presentation about STEM to another school district talking about how influential you were to her and how you helped her realize that she could do that as well. I think she really connected with you. You have made a difference in the lives of my students and I really appreciate that.\n\nWhen I told Mary Shaw this story on the rail platform, she said, “YES!!”, complete with a fist pump. She seemed excited to hear of another female software engineer in the making. I felt whole in that moment, simultaneously looking up to Mary Shaw and realizing how I had impacted the next generation.\n\n## Becoming part of the cycle of life\n\nHave you noticed how time seems to fly by? In writing this piece, someone told me, “how we affect the next generation makes us immortal.” What are you doing to positively impact someone in your life with the time you have?\n\nBeing a mentor requires putting your own ego aside and wanting others to succeed. Once I grew more comfortable with myself and less competitive with others, I found I had more room in my heart to cheer them on. Being a mentor means listening to what people want to do and encouraging them, while being strategic. It’s delightful and rewarding to see something positive develop from time spent together.\n\n## Make a difference.\n\nAs our careers mature, it’s important that we to contribute back to the world. Do work that matters, and you’ll make a difference every day. Or, if your job is sustainable but not as fulfilling, you could spend some of your time helping and connecting with others: volunteering with local youth groups, mentoring someone getting started in your industry, or teaching for a nonprofit. Organizations like [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) provide learning and career development opportunities to women and newcomers in technology–they often need teaching assistants and instructors. Other groups to check out: [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/), [Coder Dojo](https://coderdojo.com/), or a local meetup.\n\nThere are many places in and outside of tech where you could give your time and expertise. Looking for some variety in your life? Contributions to organizations like the Humane Society or a local trail association would be just as appreciated. Find something that matters to you.\n\nComing from a place of privilege–like, being further along in a well-paying career–means you have something to offer those coming after you. Trend on positive, meaningful outcomes for others with the time you spend. Every little bit helps to make our world a better place. In nature terms, did you leave the trail in a better condition than you found it?","src/content/posts/whats-your-legacy/index.mdx",[1317],"e238dc6f67940741","writing-winning-talk-abstracts",{"id":1350,"data":1352,"body":1357,"filePath":1358,"assetImports":1359,"digest":1361,"deferredRender":24},{"title":1353,"date":1354,"path":1355,"coverImage":1356},"Writing winning abstracts",["Date","2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z"],"/writing-winning-talk-abstracts","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./Excited-1.jpg","![I'm so freakin' excited](./Excited-1.jpg)\n\nDo you want to speak at conferences more? Do you submit to CFPs but struggle to have your proposals accepted? Perhaps writing an abstract puts you off from submitting entirely...? Let's change that.\n\nI want to help because there are countless conferences and speaking opportunities around the world just waiting for you. There's also a real need to spread the word about accessibility to keep improving the Web for people with disabilities. I'm but one, admittedly burned-out, public speaker. We need more voices and a stream of new ideas to keep improving accessibility awareness as our industry grows.\n\n## What qualifies me to say?\n\nI've done my [fair share of public speaking](/talks/) in the past few years, with many of those talks originating as CFPs (Calls for Papers). Eventually, I started doing invited keynotes. I learned some things along the way that increased the likelihood that one of my proposals would be accepted when I did submit a CFP. I'd like to share them with you. Please recognize that these are just starting points and your mileage may vary. However, if you want to be a public speaker, submitting a winning abstract is key to breaking in.\n\n## Turning speaker excitement into reality\n\nEarlier in my career, I attended a few tech conferences and experienced an adrenaline rush sitting in the audience. I wanted to get into public speaking _really bad_. I had things to say. I was excited about getting up in front of people for a bit of show-and-tell. To be honest, I was also psyched about the travel. I couldn't afford to travel without it subsidized by work or a conference in some way, and I saw a big opportunity there.\n\nIf you have that excitement, put it to work! Raise your profile by producing blog content that means something to you and will also provide value to your readers; there has to be something in it for them to want to listen to you.\n\nWriting about your work or side projects can give you material for talks, so it's less of a strain to come up with a topic. It also gives your name credibility if that content starts to make the rounds on social media and industry newsletters.\n\n## Do your homework\n\n### Picking the right event\n\nA big part of public speaking success is setting your sights on gigs that are actually attainable. Some events hold CFPs, while some are invite-only. Whether you are invited depends entirely on your career, experience, and who you know. Are you going to start out speaking at An Event Apart? Most likely not, but there are plenty of other events that welcome talk submissions and promote new speakers.\n\nWhen submitting to conference CFP's, whether you are local, regional or international will impact your chances of being accepted. It can also depend whether the conference is in-person or remote. You may have to adjust your expectations of where you expect to speak versus where you actually are in your career (see a bonus embarrassing story at the [end of this blog post](#end-of-post)).\n\nSubmit to local events first to gain experience and exposure. You can gradually build up to bigger events once you've proven yourself as a speaker. You can also benefit at any point in your speaking career by practicing talks at local meetups before taking them to larger conferences. Local meetups are awesome!\n\n### Research on the event\n\nBefore submitting a proposal you must do some research on your chosen conference to know how your talk might fit in. What were the talks about in previous years? Is the audience design-focused, or are they mostly developers? Will an in-the-weeds technical talk go over best for the audience or will they benefit from a high-level, over-arching talk? A winning proposal will identify how your topic fits in with the overall conference agenda. It should highlight who stands to benefit from learning from you and what they'll get out of it.\n\n### Become a part of the community\n\nIf you're in a position to attend an event before submitting a talk, you can gain insight and experience to use to your advantage. For example, which talks went well? How would your take on a subject fit in to the talk schedule? By experiencing an event before you submit a talk, you can also potentially network with the very people who will approve your proposal. Admittedly, this is easier and cheaper to do at local conferences, but it's worth a shot.\n\nWhen applicable (i.e. not during lockdown times), it can improve your speaker mojo to attend happy hours and tech conference after-hours events with established speakers when they're in town. Even if you feel like a groupie. These are valuable opportunities to make industry connections that lead to things later on: perhaps the person you met organizes an event in their own city and they have a CFP? Give them your business card and submit a proposal!\n\nFor members of underrepresented groups, look for opportunity scholarships and community events related to conferences. They can connect you with event organizers as well as new peers and friends who can give you a boost.\n\n#### It helps to attend conferences if you want to speak at said conferences\n\nAfter getting turned down as a speaker at JSConf US, I finally \"broke in\" after:\n\n1. Buying a ticket and going anyway\n2. Doing a [talk in the open B track](/talk/jsconf-2014/)\n3. Submitting to the CFP again the next year\n\nBy showing up to the event even though my proposal didn't get accepted, I learned a lot about JavaScript and expanded my network. I met people who were on the speaker committee without realizing it, and I even made a few rad friends! I had the privilege of making an investment in my career that year by taking time off and paying my own way to the conference. A conference budget from your employer or fundraiser could also help you get there.\n\nWhen I submitted again the next year, I finally made it into the A track where they paid for speaker travel. I worked hard to get there, so when it finally happened I felt I'd earned it.\n\n[![Welcome to Marklar](./marklar-1.jpg)](http://marcysutton.github.io/accessibility-of-web-components/slides.html#/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nMy JSConf B-Track Debut. There was IRL taco delivery involved\n\n## Writing the best proposal ever\n\nA proposal is a teaser for your talk. It should tell the reader what they will learn but leave them wanting more. What's the hook that makes your talk different so it stands out from the rest, without trying too hard?\n\nYou don't have to know everything about the topic when you write the abstract; in fact, you should leave some mystery for the talk itself! You have time to research and fill in the details after you submit the abstract. If that conference says no, try to find a similar one and submit again.\n\nEncourage organizers from afar who may not know you to say yes by writing a blog post expanding further on your proposed topic. It helps to establish credibility and your level of interest in that subject if you don't already have a body of work on it.\n\n### Ask for feedback on your proposals\n\nAfter you've done your homework and decided on a topic, write a proposal and get feedback on it. Ask a colleague or a mentor who has done public speaking for peer review to get a second opinion: even better if you find someone who's spoken at that event before. This is especially important when you're just getting started, as you calibrate your \"idea generator\" and learn to write for maximum impact.\n\n## Accessibility at Mainstream Conferences\n\nRepeat after me: accessibility talks can be accepted at mainstream conferences. Write a competitive abstract that's so good and relevant, they can't say no! But, recognize your proposal has to make it through the selection process along with everyone else's, with or without your name on it (depending on the selection process).\n\nYour proposal should be able to win on its own merits. It is possible! If you're having to ask for favors to get in as a speaker, maybe your abstracts could use bolder ideas and more polish.\n\nHere's one way to think about it: what would be the freshest take on accessibility at that particular point in time, and how to propose that topic? What would be the most relevant for that event? Start with a big idea and work back from there to fill in the details.\n\n> ### “WebVR & Accessibility would be pretty current in 2017. Free idea for someone”\n> \n> –Me\n\nSidebar: Is it sad that there aren't always accessibility talks at conferences? Yes. Did you see a conference that needed more inclusive talks? Sounds like a great target for submitting to a CFP next year! Conferences are interested in accessibility talks, in my experience, especially if you tailor your story to their audience. Make it compelling with a single paragraph abstract, and you're bound to see better acceptance rates. Don't expect a generic talk or an old repeat to win everyone over; that's not accessibility's fault!\n\n### They said no. What now?\n\nI got a lot of \"no\"s when I was starting out. Someone said I should ask for feedback, so that's what I did. The first \"no\" I actually benefited from was for a brand-new conference in San Francisco, and I was in Seattle. I emailed to ask why my proposal wasn't accepted, and their response altered my approach to public speaking forever:\n\n> #### “Accessibility has been solved. We want more original topics.”\n\n![What?](./what.gif)\n\nI changed my approach to accessibility talks after that. I started focusing on the accessibility implications of newer technologies, like Shadow DOM or client-rendered JavaScript frameworks, illustrating how that conference had it wrong. Accessibility hasn't been \"solved\", because people with disabilities are still presented with barriers on the web all the time. I see that as incentive to keep speaking, keep working, and keep contributing to accessibility. We need all the help we can get.\n\nThe next \"no\" I got was for an international conference in Europe. I asked again why I didn't get accepted, and they said \"we really liked your proposal, but we're out of budget for international speakers. If you can get yourself here, you can speak.\" I couldn't afford it, so I declined. But that feedback was HUGE! I went from thinking my proposal was a failure to learning that they were out of budget, so I knew I was close: that proposal may have been accepted closer to home. All it took was emailing them to solicit feedback! That was an important part of developing my skills.\n\n**Update 4/25/17:** Since I wrote this post, I received a \"no\" on one of my talk proposals to DinosaurJS. In fact, I am a bit relieved because I want to take the summer off from speaking. But I wanted to point out a key line in their response email, highlighted in bold:\n\n> Hello. We’re sorry that your proposal was not selected for DinosaurJS 2017.... **If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us.**\n\nThat's your cue to kindly ask for feedback, if you need it! Now you know.\n\n## Be an accessible, persuasive speaker\n\nPublic speakers should leave the audience feeling good. The purpose of getting up in front of a conference (usually) is to spread awareness about a new technology or initiative, teach people something, and entertain them. As an audience member, I value when speakers are approachable and bring me along, rather than making me feel bad because I'm not on their level yet. If they show a bit of vulnerability by saying how they failed before getting it right, even better.\n\nWhen I first got into accessibility, I felt like established people in the industry wagged their fingers a lot and talked about the problems but didn't offer many solutions. I decided to contribute my own take on it by writing about new technologies and their impact on accessibility, which created great material for public speaking.\n\nIt's partly about your chosen topic, but also largely how you present yourself. People will want to learn more if you don't make them feel bad for skipping out on your topic before at work (I had to learn that as a speaker, myself). Persuade the audience to follow your position, even if they have to gain empathy or do actual work to get there. _\"Just learning about accessibility? Here's how you can start today!\"_\n\n## Resources\n\nMany great public speakers have written about these topics. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend learning from these experts:\n\n- [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- Karolina Szczur: [How to Write a Successful Conference Proposal](https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32 \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- Lara Hogan: [Demystifying Public Speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- Brenna O'Brien: [Coaching for Public Speakers](http://brennaobrien.com/coaching/ \"Link opens in a new window\")\n- Jenn Lukas: [A Formula for Speaking Fees](http://www.thenerdary.net/post/84544230452/a-formula-for-speaking-fees \"Link opens in a new window\")\n\nHopefully this is helpful to you. I really enjoy public speaking and I hope that everyone who wants to do it gets the chance. There are opportunities out there to make an impact on any topic you choose, provided you persuade people to listen. What's your next move?\n\n## And now for that bonus embarrassing story\n\nI once attended a conference in New Zealand where I met a speaker who suggested \"maybe you can email the organizers and get in, I think they may have room.\" I did, feeling in the moment like I didn't have much to lose by asking, and their \"bless your heart\" response was more than kind. But no. After attending and looking back on it years later, I know that particular event is invite-only and highly coveted among established public speakers. I had zero chance and put myself out there for no reason, although my networking drive at that time was extremely pivotal in my career. I still dream about speaking there some day.\n\n![Webstock Speaker Dinner](./webstock-dinner.jpg)\n\nCrashing a speaker dinner in New Zealand","src/content/posts/writing-winning-talk-abstracts/index.mdx",[1360],"./Excited-1.jpg","fc641cbe3830dc30"]
